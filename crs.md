### CRS systems that are useful in practice

* 4326 - [[gps]] systems work in this one, so it's kinda a "raw data" system
* 3875 - best system to show maps (pseudo-Mercator?), as it preserves shapes, but it doesn't preserve scale
* 3035 - a good system to measure distances and areas (all measurements are in meters), but not a good one to plot
