# Reddit as an outreach tool

Very interesting description of moderation at AskHistorians: from biases in questions (very man-oriented, often biased towards sex, torture, slavery, cheap shock-like excitement), through constant outrage about moderation ("mods are fashists" - after deleting hundreds of stupid jokes), and to blatant sexism (abuse of mods who are openly female).

It's like a thankless vocational work. Unbelievable. Not just outreach, but seriously more akin to spreading the good word in the enemy camp :)
