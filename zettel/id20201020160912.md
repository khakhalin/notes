Parents: [[recruiting]], [[job_search]]

Key quotation: In the midst of a talent shortage, companies ignore the candidates who apply to them and pay recruiters without domain expertise to chase the same ten engineers with the same credentials. 

Interviewing is so expensive and so noisy that people rely on each other in vetting candidates, creating a 2-tiered system: people who want to work, but are completely ignored, and people who don't necessarily want to change their employer, but are abused by recruiter's spam.

The bottleneck is in **credentialing**, or somehow making sure that candidates actually can do the work.
