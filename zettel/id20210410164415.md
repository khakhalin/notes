A collection of experiences, but with the main message that people hire people that are similar to them. If they go with a rubric, they populate it with abstract random questions (examples that he brings up are a very specific explanation of what backprop is, and using YOLO network). So he's against rubrics.

# My thoughts

This critique relies on two ideas: 
* that we are trying to maximize candidate's score on a rubric, 
* and that this rubric is not evidence-based

(Which suggests that that is how people hire right now)

But it seems to be me that it doesn't have to be like that. One can imagine two ways of using rubrics that is good:
* A pre-conceived rubric used only as a triage mechanism; when one has to show some minimal proficiency in those skills that are critical for the work. Ideally the skills should be also driven from actual working practice, but sometimes it's more about knowing the background language.
* A rubric that is calibrated on current employees, to make sure that the target is reasonable. (Would this be met with lots of resistance?)

But that said, the only real predictor of work performance is work performance, either past, or in a model situation (take-home test, or an onsite).
