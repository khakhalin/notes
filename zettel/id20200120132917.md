Key points:
* **Structured inqury** is good. The "inquiry" part is about not falling to memorization, as it is useless
* But need also be "structured". Cognitive overload and lack of scaffolding also ruin things
* Another good thing: when math is not presented in a stereoptypical academic content (academic hierarchy), as kids self-identify like crazy, as either geeky or non-mathy
* Growth mindset

This makes me thing that the term **growth mindset** is actually used in two rather different ways. One, and that's the one that doesn't work, is this very specific priming idea in psychology, in which you're trying to subtly brainwash a person into believing in growth, and then they supposedly learn better. Except that they don't, as it didn't replicate (*did it?*). Another one, like used here, is rather about tricking people into not shutting down by self-categorization.
