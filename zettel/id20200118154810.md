A nice tweet-thread about "unfair" questions in a discussion, analogous to cheap moves in board games, that almost feel like a form of bullying against new players, even though they  are would not pose that much of a problem to more experienced players.

* (to a psychologist): "The measurement of people reduces them to a list of numbers, doing violence to the complexity of their experience and the depth of their being."
* (to a neuroscientist): "It's unsurprising that this process is implemented in the brain, how could it be any other way? What does your work tell us about the purely psychological content of the process?"
* (to a composer): "You presented this work as a critique of colonialism, but because you are in a position of power, its actual function is to occupy space that could otherwise be used to center the work of the oppressed."
* (to a critical theorist): "This critical approach is self-undermining—the same method can be used to show that any application of it is itself contingent and ungrounded."
* (to an educator): "Your intervention cannot yet be applied system-wide, which means it cannot be implemented equitably."
* (to me, in about 45 minutes): “Interesting how you analogize interdisciplinary research to abstract strategy games, when in fact research is not a game, and people’s livelihoods are at stake.”

The problem is not that these questions are wrong; it's that they are unproductive, and effectively shut down people who are not too well versed in interdisciplinary dialogue. So people get offended, personal, and derail the conversation.

Used by the author as an argument for distant interdisciplinary collaborations :)
