# Keyboard Shortcuts

#language #note

Keyboard shortcuts feel like language dialects. You don’t talk to ppl directly; but if your movements don’t match a new software, you’re hamstrung. I stopped using Word when it dropped Ctrl-Shift-V for “paste text”. It’s ridiculous how annoying this simple muscle memory can be!

I never realized until about last year just how often I use the ancient “cut” shortcut, Shift-Del, until newer editors (DropboxPaper) stopped supporting it. I didn’t even know it’s still sitting there in my motor circuits, but it’s there. Like having an accent in your fingers!

And as with accents, these subconscious attempts to to Shift-Del actually speak tons about me as a person; about where I learned, and when I learned it!
