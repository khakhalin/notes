Harnessing behavioral diversity to understand neural computations for cognition Simon Musall, Anne E Urai, David Sussillo, Anne K Churchland
 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438819300285 
Potentially the most important section: "Relating rich behavior to neural activity by studying ANNs"

25 years of criticality in neuroscience — established results, open controversies, novel concepts J Wilting, V Priesemann
 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438819300248 
Very short, so a must read.

Relating network connectivity to dynamics: opportunities and challenges for theoretical neuroscience Carina Curto, Katherine Morrison
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438819300443 
Review. Exactly what it should be (networks, motifs, dynamics)

Cortical computations via metastable activity Giancarlo La Camera, Alfredo Fontanini, Luca Mazzucato
 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438818302198 
Interesting; includes a section of spiking models of those. It's like criticality, but better, and also super-relevant.


Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks Niru Maheswaranathan, Alex H. Williams, Matthew D. Golub, Surya Ganguli, David Sussillo

Reservoir computer + a "working memory network"

Learning predictive structure without a teacher: decision strategies and brain routes Zoe Kourtzi, Andrew E Welchman

The language of the brain: real-world neural population codes J Andrew Pruszynski, Joel Zylberberg
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438818302137 
Mostly (only?) about motor cortex, and how representation works there. Seems useful and accessible.

Data-driven models in human neuroscience and neuroengineering Bingni W. Brunton, Michael Beyeler. 
A review of current ML solutions for this general problem; still may be useful.

An argument for hyperbolic geometry in neural circuits Tatyana O Sharpee
Interesting, but not immediately clear. But intriguing. Not much math, so should be very readable.

About what tunes inhibitory neurons, that in turn make excitatory activity properly sparse.

Mind the last spike — firing rate models for mesoscopic populations of spiking neurons Tilo Schwalger, Anton V Chizhov

Training deep neural density estimators to identify mechanistic models of neural dynamics
Gonçalves .. Macke 2019
About how to use deep learning to guess neuronal parameters to fit the actual activity of the network (?) They seem to be looking at actual V(t) though.

Interrogating theoretical models of neural computation with deep inference
Bittner .. Cunningham 2019
Apparently a very similar paper (to Goncalves 2019), but independent.

Recurrent neural network models of multi-area computation underlying decision-making Michael Kleinman, Chandramouli Chandrasekaran, Jonathan C Kao
It seems that they try recurrent networks (RNN) running in parallel, and compare their decision times to that from monkey cortex. Then show that one RNN doesn't match the distribution of times, but if you have several running in parallel, and then synthesizing info, you get similar results? Claim that different modes of distributed computation are experimentally testable like that.

Balleine, B. W. (2019). The Meaning of Behavior: Discriminating Reflex and Volition in the Brain. *Neuron*, *104*(1), 47-62. 
Review. Potentially an interesting paper on free will, behaviorally (and computationally?) defined.

The Dialectics of Free Energy Minimization Evert A. Boonstra and Heleen A. Slagter
Seems to be a review explaining the free energy minimization principle for an organism. It's not math though; looks almost like philosophy?
