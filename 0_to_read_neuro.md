About what tunes inhibitory neurons, that in turn make excitatory activity properly sparse.

The Dialectics of Free Energy Minimization Evert A. Boonstra and Heleen A. Slagter
Seems to be a review explaining the free energy minimization principle for an organism. It's not math though; looks almost like philosophy?

Training deep neural density estimators to identify mechanistic models of neural dynamics
Gon√ßalves .. Macke 2019
About how to use deep learning to guess neuronal parameters to fit the actual activity of the network (?) They seem to be looking at actual V(t) though.

Interrogating theoretical models of neural computation with deep inference
Bittner .. Cunningham 2019
Apparently a very similar paper (to Goncalves 2019), but independent.

Recurrent neural network models of multi-area computation underlying decision-making Michael Kleinman, Chandramouli Chandrasekaran, Jonathan C Kao
It seems that they try recurrent networks (RNN) running in parallel, and compare their decision times to that from monkey cortex. Then show that one RNN doesn't match the distribution of times, but if you have several running in parallel, and then synthesizing info, you get similar results? Claim that different modes of distributed computation are experimentally testable like that.

Balleine, B. W. (2019). The Meaning of Behavior: Discriminating Reflex and Volition in the Brain. *Neuron*, *104*(1), 47-62. 
Review. Potentially an interesting paper on free will, behaviorally (and computationally?) defined.
