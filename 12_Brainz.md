Training deep neural density estimators to identify mechanistic models of neural dynamics
Gon√ßalves .. Macke 2019
About how to use deep learning to guess neuronal parameters to fit the actual activity of the network (?) They seem to be looking at actual V(t) though.

Supposedly, explains the development of grid cells, synthesizing two existing theories (recurrent with lateral inhibition and spontaneous development during navigation?)
