# On organizing a remote conference

#edu #management

Ideas / advice:
* Zoom cloud recording (? #todo)
* Disable Zoom chat; use Slack for chat (better organized, persistent, conversations can be continued after the event)
* Webinars can't be raided (as link only allows to watch, not interrupt)
* Pre-recorded talks may be an option, follows by a live discussion
