Showed simple abstract art to people, either human or computer-generated, assingned titles at random (either profound, simple matter-of-fact, or no title), and asked to assess the art. Profound (aka "BS") titles earned higher appraisals (~10-15% higher on a 5-point scale, with a pretty average average) than either untitled or mundane (the latter two were very similar). Tested on 200 students; correlations between ratings ~0.7-0.8.
