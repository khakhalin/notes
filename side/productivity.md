* An extreme case of Goodhart's Law, about a reasonable measure (that can originally be used to identify problematic areas within the organization) becoming an gameable, self-sufficient, counterproductive, and ultimately - destructive target
* The earlier in the value-generating chain you measure, the easier it is, but the less relevant and more gameable it becomes (obvious examples: lines of code written, or the number of merge requests that drops for an engineer learning a new language)
* Meaningful measurements are possible (they describe DORA and SPACE), but they are more impact-oriented, and trust managers more, in terms of assessing their teams
* Business understanding that comes only from regular efforts to undertand the business, and results in better and more effective ideas (cheaper, and more impactful) is hard to measure. But it's also one of the main qualities of a good team
* However, measuring only impact (individual impact) discourages collaboration, [[glue_work]]

A nice summary of negatives for every measure:
* Effort -> busiwork, elimination of "free time" for thinking, learning, collaborating
* Output -> quantity over quality, gaming task size, loss of focus
* Outcomes -> shortcuts in quality
* Impact -> loss of collaboration, long-term planning

A better approach: impact calculations for the team as a whole (money geneerated per project); hands-on within the team (let managers manage); measuring efforts and outcome as an optional personal exercise for self-improvement
