## Andrew Clark

Philosophy prof and author from U Edinburg ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Clark)). Apparently leading author on philosophy of mind extension; doing math on paper as a classicall example. "The boundary of skin and skull as arbitrary and cotnigively meaningless" (quoting wiki). Parity principle: there's no reason to rank different ways to achieve the same result (say, a mathematical calculation) if the result and the efficiency are the same.

> Mathematical formalistm is a great first example, but language is another one people rarely appreciate to its full extent. And then drawing figures (just Google "how to draw human figure") may be another example that, again, is seriously under-appreciated by non-professionals.

Also works on the general philosophy of cognitive processes, and on how we don't just produce responses to inputs, but are engaged in a never-ending quest in predicting inputs (predictive processing).

> Natural-Born Cyborgs (that I happen to have) is one of his books, but he wrote like 5 more.
