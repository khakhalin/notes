* **Program managemers** are responsible for projects, have a lot of power over their stream of research, and can move money around quickly. Key figures. Curious, independent, and have low ego. Contracts of only 5 years.
* Programs are designed in a way that shifts risks from developers. A program is a **high-risk entreprise that is build of many low-risk projects**, so while only ~10% of projects are terminated before completion, only about 10% of programs deliver transformative results, and this is by design. It allows tackling systemic problems.

> Sorta the opposite of "normal science", right? Instead of a percolation model, a probabilistic pull model.

* Performer days - small internal private conferences for networking and exchange of ideas.
* They don't hire people with web-presence. They actually pay less. Patriotism. Elite club? Specific mentality?
* Flat organizational structure, a lot of internal discussions.

> It's interesting: about half of PM time and effort goes into networking (making key people meet each other), and yet they should have no internet presence (pre-DARPA). That's a curious combination of qualities.
