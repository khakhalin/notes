Older
* Peter Brook - The Pennine Painter
* Mstislav Dobuzhinsky - obviously
* Maurice Wade - precisionism of dark (almost black) shadows, and reflections
* Takeo Takei - those crazy semi-abstract birds from 1960s are fire! Balanced and deconstructed.
* Esa Riippa - Finnish painter, empty, Wyeth-y, but from 1980s Finland. Feels almost Estonian, ukwim?
* Theodore Major - gray hazy semi-abstract industrial landscapes
* Pete Monaghan - a poet of weird broken chaotic self-made architecture
* David Utting - red geometrical roofs of coastal towns
* Edward Okuń - from 1913, as if preraphaelites discovered LSD. Butterflies, gold.
* John Scorror O'Connor - postimpressionist landscapes with explosions of reeds and bushes. Yellows, blacks, and reds.
* Lennart Helje - illustrator of nordic tales, for children's book, magic 80s
* Richard Diebenkorn - abstract landscapes
* Michiel Schrijver - geometric a bit crooked fantasy townscapes, lots of flat surfaces
* Paul Nash - perfect abstract landscape, between precisionism and surrealism
* Bernard Buffet - landscapes, a bit 80s half drawings, half-illustrations, half-oil paintings, nervious and pointy. Very geometrical, but in a unique, meshy way, often with exaggerated 1-point perspective
* Roger Eliot Fry - look at his landscapes. Nerviously iconographic
* Chris ten Bruggen Kate - almost suprematist landscapes with large square colored skies
* Ethelbert White - look at his advertisement posters (not so much oil landscape)
* George Inness - landscapes dissolving into diffusing clouds, yet firmly 19 century. American, oil.
* Kiyoshi Saitō - woodcut winter landscapes
* Jack Simcock - similar to Peter Brook, but a bit less naive, more Wyethy, and a bit crooked. Some a crazy Tarkovskian though
* George Callaghan - Lots of lil houses with roofs, kinda kitsch, but would be fun to copy
* Geoffrey Key - semi-abstract geometrical landscapes are interesting
* Wayne Thiebaud - interesting still-lifes, just slightly distorted, and just a lil bit kitch
* Gabriele Munter - postimpressionist landscapes, a bit sezannish-gauguinnish
* Marc-Aurèle Fortin - crooked a bit cartoonish landscapes from Quebec
* Alexander Archipenko - suprematist wooden sculpture
* Natalia Goncharova - obviously
* Mike Hall - landscapes that are almost realist, but still a bit flattened, misty-posterized
* Michele Marieschi - one of those 18 century Italian painters with ruins, leaves, pastorales, bridges, and other architectural fantasies
* Paolo Anesi - another simialr 18 century Italian. How (adorable) kitsch looked like in 18 century!
* Jaime Heiden - naked trees with skies as a backdrop
* Karin Larsson - Svedish interior designer from early 20c that basically invented Ikea and 60s, but better
* Hilma af Klint - inventor of abstract art (before Kandinsky. But Hildegard von Bingen is also cool)
