An interesting blog post / presentation / summary about "glue work": the type of "service work" that needs to be done (coordinating, onboarding, helping, facilitating), but often comes onrecognized, and is actually dangerous.

For junior people, it takes their time from what should progress their careers, and channels them from technical work to managerial / administrative work. Reviews, meetings, one-on-ones, mentorship, onboarding, documentation. At the same time, usually, this work doesn't come with an official title (as a project lead), and so doesn't lead to promotion, and even if it does, it may be a wrong type of promotion (in her example: a project manager, instead of senior software engineer).

An inherent conflict: often the thing that would bring the most impact for the project is not the thing that would advance your career most.

Clear expectations are the key. If a project manager does most of the work, it's fine. If people are sharing openly, it's also fine. Expecting people to volunteer is not.

Two scenarios:
* Sometimes work that wouldn't benefit one person, would benefit another one (say, organizing an event - for an HR vs Engineer)
* Sometimes it personally benefits noone - then it needs to be shared fairly, and tracked.

General idea: choose a role you like, and want to get better at. You will only get better at what you spend time on! 

This includes explicitly learning during work hours. Not after hours.

Also, getting less technical is a one-way path. If you step away from a technical role, it closes doors.

In many fields, "project manager" is a kiss of death for technical positions.

How to get "Unglued"? (If you're doing too much glue work)
* Have a career conversation
* Get a useful job title
* Tell the story (artifacts of impact)
* If nothing else works: stop doing glue work, and do exactly what you are required to do

The last thing includes a radical cynical thing: "Don't catch things that are about to drop".

For people who are called to support diversity: Getting promoted is the ultimate diversity work!
