# Random notes

Sometimes it feels that traditional religion is that complicated (in its hymnography, rituals, theology) because saturation is the only way to correct the weirdness of original premises. When you cannot change your holy texts, you have to hide them in a tapestry of ornaments. Some people may find it problematic: aren't these complexities distracting us from the core? Shouldn't we return to the basics? But the thing is, the holy texts of many (most?) religions are just snapshots of ongoing polemics, imperfect, noisy, and randomly immortalized. And then you are caught in this situation when you can only add things; you cannot remove stuff (at least not from the heart, from the canon). So if something in the "heart" of your tradition is weird, you can only distract from it. Nobody thinks about it consciously, of course; there is no single person who would decide to obfuscate everything just a little bit more. But by little choices, little biases, people carefully disguise those parts of the core that bother them. And that's probably good?

(Like, look at the gospel of Luke. The parables are clearly in the wrong order. Whomever was writing this book, just couldn't put them in an order that would make sense, at least not compared to Matthew. But they tried! They weren't content with just a collection of sayings. And by doing so, they obviously put things from context, or even put them in a wrong context. It's pretty much obvious if you just read the book. But we are stuck with it now, so all we can is to write layers and layers on top of it, carefully disassembling these texts, and restructuring, reinterpreting them poetically. Because since 120 CE or so we can no longer write a "new synoptic gospel", but we can still write hymns. Except now we write hymns about hymns about hymns. And maybe that's fine, maybe that's good?)
