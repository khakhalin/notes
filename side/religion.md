# Random notes

Sometimes it feels that text-rooted traditional religions get so complicated with time (in their hymnography, rituals, theology) mostly because content saturation is the only way to correct for the weirdness of original premises. When the holy texts are unchangeable, you have to hide them behind a tapestry of increasingly ornamental readings. Eventually, some people start to find it problematic; they start to wonder if perhaps these complexities are distracting people from the core. People are tempted to return to some sort of idealized basics, to the pure origins. But the thing is, the holy texts of many (most?) religions originated as somewhat arbtitrary snapshots of ongoing polemics. Even when developed as a programmatic statements, they still captured the discussions of the moment. And now noisy and somewhat arbitrary snapshots of these old discussions are immortalized, frozen in the texts.

People find themselves caught in a situation when they can only add things; they cannot remove texts from the canon (at least not easily). When something in the "heart" of a living tradition happens to ring oddly in a new moment, centuries after the texts were created, the only way to counter this friction is to distract from it. I don't think anyone is consciously thinking about this process in these categories; no single person takes on themselves the liberty to introduce distractions to the canon; everyone thinks that they are just making thigs clearer, just translating, clarifying, interpreting old ideas, to cut off "incorrect" readings. But because obfuscation is the only working tool they have, they end up obfuscating the message with these layers of interpretation. And over time, with these little choices, these little scattered historical biases, people end up disguising the parts of the original story that bothers them the most.
