# Random notes

Sometimes it feels that text-rooted traditional religions get so complicated with time (in their hymnography, rituals, theology) mostly because content saturation is the only way to correct for the weirdness of original premises. When the holy texts are unchangeable, you have to hide them behind a tapestry of increasingly ornamental readings. Eventually, some people start to find it problematic: aren't these complexities distracting us from the core? Shouldn't we return to the basics? But the thing is, the holy texts of many (most?) religions originated as somewhat arbtitrary snapshots of ongoing polemics. Even when developed as a programmatic statements, they still captured the discussions of the moment, and now these discussions got imperfectly, noisily, and randomly immortalized, frozen in the texts. And then people find themselves caught in this situation when they can only add things; they cannot remove texts from the canon (at least not easily). So if something in the "heart" of a living tradition happens to ring oddly in a new moment, years after the texts were created, the only way to counter this friction is to distract from it. Nobody thinks about it consciously, of course; no single person takes on themselves the libery to "correct" the wrong; everyone things that they are just making an existing "right" clearer, but because obfuscation is the only working tool they have, they end up obfuscating the message with additional layers of interpretation. And over time, with these little choices, little biases, people carefully disguise those parts of the core canon that bother them.
