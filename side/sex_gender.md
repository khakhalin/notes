Men may be larger than women not because of some evolutionary optimization, but as a weird byproduct of higher estrogen in women (that causes bones to fuse earlier). According to this hypothesis, higher estrogen is biologically relevant, and everything bone may be just a byproduct.
Uses other primates (chimps) as a counter-point for a statement that female pelvis is larger in primates even when there's no problem with childbirth.

Another paper from the same review:

DeWitte, S. N. (2018). Stress, sex, and plague: Patterns of developmental stress and survival in pre‐and post‐Black Death London. American Journal of Human Biology, 30(1), e23073.

"After the Black Death, the bubonic plague pandemic that ravaged Europe in the 14th century, the average height difference between males and females increased by 62%: Men got about 9 centimeters taller and women got 5.5 centimeters shorter." Why? Better food → earlier maturation in women → earlier estrogen → smaller body size. (Really??? wow!)
