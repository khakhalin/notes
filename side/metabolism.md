* When people are involved in a hard mental task (in this case, students memorizing sequences), they breathe about 3 times faster (but shallower), and consume about 2 times more oxygen.

* Mental arithmetic (hard!) doesn't change oxygen consumption.

* For self-control though, the answer seems to be "no": there's no obvious increase in brain metabolism.

* About 10% increase in oxygen consumption during thinking (nothing too hard: just careful memory-based imagining activities, like walking in a familiar setting, turning, performing actions etc.)

* Solving a harder task (Stroop test with a dissonance) is accompanied with about 3 times faster decrease of blood glucose than for a simple task (Stroop test with congruence). They did it for 30 minutes.
