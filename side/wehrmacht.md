# Wehrmacht and other Nazi terms

#language

Parent: [[german]]

An interesting thread about why in English, Soviet army (or any other army for that matter) is translated ("Soviet Army"), but so many Nazi terms are left untranslated (Wehrmacht, panzer, Reich, FÃ¼hrer, Luftwaffe etc.) Why is it so?

They claim that it's, at least partially, romantization. And as such, it's bad, and these terms are better be translated. But at the same time, there are a few words (Reich, Volk, Reichstag, Kaiser) that are impossible to translate extactly, so it's easier to leave them as is.
