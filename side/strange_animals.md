That plant that looks like a blob
Those giant unicellular plants
That copepod (?) with eyes like scopes

Naked mole rats have dialects in different colonies and kill intruders:

(they used random forest on spectrogram shape, got about 70% colony matching accuracy)

**Jacana** - an african bird with giant legs that also looks as if it had 6 legs, as it typically carries its (rather large) chicks under its wings.

**Epomis** - a beetle larva that tries to get swallowed by a frog, then eats it from inside. [ref](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/absurd-creature-of-the-week-this-toad-isnt-eating-a-bug-the-bug-is-eating-it/)

**Amblyopsis hoosieri** - a cave-dwelling fish from Indiana with anus (almost) in its mouth. Also no eyes. Great for fertilizing eggs.

**Mantis shrimp** has a crapload of different optical receptors, but actually doesn't discriminate colors better than humans. An exaple of an alternative color-discrimination architecture, optimized for a narrow tasks.

**Chlamisus laticollis** is a small beetle shaped like poop (frass). This funny barrel-like shape makes it harder for it to mate (from the pure geometry point of view), but it manages.

**Dendrogaster tobasuii** - a parasitic crustacean (gross) of starfish, that looks totally fractal. A fractal tree that is three, maybe even four iterations deep.
