Schwitzgebel, E. (2009). Do ethicists steal more books?. Philosophical Psychology, 22(6), 711-725.
Seems like a bit of a pun of an article, but still ~200 citations. He (Eric Schwitzgebel) claims that if you go to the library, more ethics books are stolen than non-ethics books :) Among those obscure late-19-century books that are rarely checked out. He had some other publications on the behavior of professional ethicists, which may be worth checking out.
