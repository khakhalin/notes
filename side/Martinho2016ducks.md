Newly hatched ducklings presented a pair of objects that are either same or different (25 minutes, a moving pair).

Then (30 min later), because the poor things got imprinted, they study whether they are more likely to follow a matching pair of objects (in color and shape - but not the same stimuli they were shown originally!), or a mismatched pair. And they tended to follow whatever they were imprinted to.

Objects:
* Cilinder / cone / sphere / elongated parallepiped + cube pair
* Color (red, blue, orange)

~40 ducklings in each group.

Claim that the accuracy is comparable to reinforced learning in primates and crows. About 60-70% of ducklings followed the correct pair.

Figures in excel; no expected numbers / stats reported in the text; suplemental materials aren't available, making it overall a questionable paper. Fun, but questionable.
