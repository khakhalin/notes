Larry McEnerney on writing (potentially two best videos on post-academic writing ever):
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM - Larry McEnerney (University of Chicago Writing Program), on writing outside the academy. I often call it the "red tie" talk (writing it here to aid searching :)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM - either the same talk on a different day, or a more academic-oriented version of it - double-check at some point    

# Examples (of inspirational writing)

"Counterfactuals and Their Applications" (Chapter 4) in Pearl, J., Glymour, M., & Jewell, N. P. (2016). Causal inference in statistics: A primer. John Wiley & Sons. http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/primer-ch4.pdf
Possibly the best beginning of a tough scientific text I've seen).
