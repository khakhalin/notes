Two best videos on writing:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM - Larry McEnerney (University of Chicago Writing Program), on writing outside the academy
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM - either the same talk on a different day, or a more academic-oriented version of it - double-check at some point
