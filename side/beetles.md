Why are there so many beetles? You know this joke about how God seems to be really into beetles, as there are so many species? On trees of life, beetles look kinda almost like a pathological outgrowh; like coppiced poplar of sorts.

Well, I thought that maybe it's because they are uniquely evolvable or something, but it seems it's mostly because they got a reall cool horizontal gene transer from microbes that made them into the only animal that can digest lignins on their own.

Basically, it's some type of co-evolution with plants + horizontal gene transfer.
