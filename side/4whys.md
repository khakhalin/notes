# Tinbergen 4 "WHY"s

#behav #bio


There are 4 types of "why" question in Biology (as per Tinbergen, 1963):
1. Function - what is it for? What's the evolutionary benefit of it?
2. Mechanism - how does it work?
3. Development - where does it come from, in this organism behavior?
4. Evolution - how did it develop?

Applies to all behaviors as well.
