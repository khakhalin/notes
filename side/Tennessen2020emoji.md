A really awesome primer in human genetic diversity that uses emojis for illustration, just for fun.

A really nice metaphor of how long ago the **last common ancestor** was: imagine all your ancestors standing in a queue. In this case, the LCA for all humans is one stadium away; the earliest modern human is about one Central Park away (~50 stadiums), the earliest "actual monkey" is about one car drive away (~50 central parks), the LCA for all primates is about 5 drives, or one flight (like, about a continent).

**Other interesting statements:**
Most action of evolution is about stabilization, not diversion / change

Human genetic pool is really shallow; in most animals 2 copies of the same gene (the ones they got from 2 parents) are more diffeerent than most extreme versions across human population. Otters are more similar than us, but almost any other animal is more diverse; for some - 10-20 times more diverse. That's because we evolved so recently.

Przeworski M. 2012. Revisiting an old riddle: what determines genetic diversity levels within
species? PLoS Biol. 10:e1001388.

Interesting stories about morphs (side-blotched lizard: 3 male morphs, 2 female, all with different strategies, partially genetic)

Numata longwing: a butterfly with differently-looking morphs, imitating different poisonous butterflies

Examples of genes with high differences in populations:
* ACKR1 - malaria resistance (really overrepresented in Africa)
* LCT - lactose tolerance (more prevalent in Europe, but still not that high)
* ABCC11 - ear wax
* ABO - blood type
* EPAS1 - breathing at high elevation
* SLC24A5 - skin tone
* TRPM8 - cold tolerance
* MAOA polymorphism for high aggression (aka "warrior gene") - about 3 times more common is Northern Europe, but still not that high

Also, neat explanations of:
* How PCA works
* How genes are not a blueprint, but more like opinions at a town council meeting
* Various reasons for 2 populations to be different (different types environmental factors, and complex interplays, illustarted on a nice example with flowers)
* Nice summary of sex and gender, and how it relates to genes

Interesting philosophical question at the end: you're driving your car in a dense fog, and GPS tells you that you are either 50 or 20 meters away from a cliff. Where will you stop?
