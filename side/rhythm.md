Cutler, A. (1994). The perception of rhythm in language.

A very curious paper (ahem) that makes the point in two ways: first, by describing it, but also by demonstrating it practically. This second point may only be appareciated by a reader who attempts to read the paper unforwarned, and then is asked to compare their perception of the text with one they have if they read the same paper out loud.
