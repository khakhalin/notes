## STAR Method

A general paradigm for answering behavioral questions. **Situation - Task - Action - Result**. Describe the Context / Challenge, then waht was done, then what was the result of it. Potentially followed with long-term lessons learned.

Typical questions:
* A conflict (disagreement, sticky situation) you had
    * either any conflict, or narrowed down: with a colleague, boss, direct report, client
* Stressful situation / work under pressure, and how you handled it
* A mistake you made, a goal you did not meet
* A goal you met, a success, going above and beyound
