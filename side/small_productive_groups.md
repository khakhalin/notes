Examples: 
* Inklings
* Bloomsbury group (English writers, early 20 century)
* Clapham Sect (group of Church of England social reformers)
* Skunkworks project (Lockheed Martin, WW2)
* Junto Club (Benjamin Franklin, mutual improvement establishment)
* Tuusula Artist Community (Finland)

Other potential groups:
* Bell labs
* Institute for Advanced Study

Core principles:
* Small group in one location, regular meeting, constant back-and-forth
* Don't accept new members easily, concentrate interactions within the group
* Autonomy
* The number of people working on each project viciously restricted. Avoid dilution of responsiblity
* Don't talk to the outside world before the project is done. Avoid dilution of what constitutes a product
* Good internal documentation, but minimal bureaucracy, minimal formal reporting

See for example: Skunkworth rules of innovation (googlable)
