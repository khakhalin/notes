# Tools, coding, project management
All sorts of infrastructure stuff.

## Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras

* Links to several tutorials: https://github.com/sayakpaul/TF-2.0-Hacks/blob/master/README.md

## Scikit-learn

* A bunch of notebooks that implement all key ML methods, by Aur√©lien Geron, to accompany his book ("Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow"): https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2

## Python tips and tricks

**Matplotlib:**
* Brief intro from Brad Solomon: https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/
* Cheatsheet: [https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-cheatsheet](<https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-cheatsheet>)

**Coding habits for data scientists:** ([ref](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists))
* Keep code clean (not smelly). Types of **smells**:
    * Dead code (commented, inconsequential)
    * Print statements everywhere
    * Bad variable names
    * Functions that do too many things instead of one thing
    * Code repetition
    * Magic values
* Smuggle code from Jupyter to classes as soon as possible (Jupyter for protopying, and maybe reporting?)
* Write unit tests ([link to a decent intro](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-testing-in-python/))
* Make small and frequent commits
