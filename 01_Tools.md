## Python tips and tricks

**Cheatsheets:**

**Coding habits for data scientists:**

* Keep code clean (not smelly). Types of smells:
    * Dead code (commented, inconsequential)
    * Print statements everywhere
    * Bad variable names
    * Functions that do too many things instead of one thing
    * Code repetition
    * Magic values
* Smuggle code from Jupyter to classes as soon as possible (Jupyter for protopying, and maybe reporting?)
* Write unit tests. A good intro:

* Make small and frequent commits
