Matrix calculus for deep learning
https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html

Awesome collection of short tutorials (both ML and snippets of Python code) by Chris Albon:

Look through, decide the priority, and how to file.

Interesting practical intro to ML projects; look through and decide how to file:

## Courses

* [Stanford, linear dynamical systems](http://stanford.edu/class/ee363/lectures.html) (Stephen Boyd) - includes stochastic control, Kalman filter, Lyapunov theory
* [Linear algebra by Gilbert Strang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) - Youtube from MIT. Everybody loves it, as it achieves a beautiful balance between staying extremely practical, concise, but at the same time giving many proofs (or "almost proofs", extreme-physics style, like for good cases, with simplifying assumptions etc). MIT also has [notes for each lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/syllabus/) (not in one pdf, but easy to find).
* [Matrix methods in data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx5Z-OslNWE&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k) (also Gilbert Strang)- YouTube from MIT. May be good for refreshing things.
* [Maximum Entropy Network Ensembles](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~gbianconi/LTCCModule) - a series of lectures
* [End-to-end machine learning](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com) - sorta like a course from Brandon Rohrer

## Books

(Given in subjective order of my gradual reading)

* How to think like a computer scientist by Allen B. Downey: [site](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/) (python)
* VLMS (Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra) by Stephen Boyd. [full pdf](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/)
* ESLII (The Elements of Statistical Learning) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman. No code. [full pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
* MML (Mathematics for Machine Learning) by M.P. Deisenroth: [full pdf](https://mml-book.github.io/)
* Algorithms by Sedgewick. Java.
* Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, by Aurélien Géron. Python / Scikit obviously. [All labs on github](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)
* Deep larning by Ian Goodfellow et al. [full pdf](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* Applied Predictive Modeling by Kuhn Johnson (no free pdf online). Code in R. Seems simpler than ESLII.
* "The 100 pages ML book" by Andriy Burkov. [full pdf](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php) 

Second priority books:
* [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/) - an interactive introduction to deep learning, based on NumPy, apparently (no TF, no PyTorch, ha!) 
* Pattern recognition and ML by Christopher Bishop ([full pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/))
* Foundations of ML by M. Mohri et al ([full pdf](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/)) - more mathy?
* ML book by K.P. Murphy - [page](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) (but no full pdf)
* Morgan, S. L., & Winship, C. (2015). Counterfactuals and causal inference (pdfs are googlable)
* [Notes on dynamical systems](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~macpd/ads/) ([pdf](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~macpd/ads/bnotes.pdf)) from Carl Dettmann. Not a textbook, but close; worth scanning

Job-search specific books:
* Cracking the code interview.
* [[Huyen2019book]] - a short book on data science / ML job interviewing

Third priority books:
* Algorithms by Erickson

Books that are not on my reading list, but keeping here just in case:
* Problem solving with data structures in Python ([full text, web](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html))
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Nielsen
* Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen: [pdf](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) (C++) - great idea, but the descriptions of algorithms are not clear, while implementations seem ideosyncratic (or maybe not; maybe I )

## Aggregators of links

* [Machine learning for humans, 80/20 reading list](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/ai-reading-list-c4753afd97a) - claims to be curated. Sections on ML, Deep, RL, and then various general readings about the meaning of it all.
* [Scientific visualization with matplotlib](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book) - an open-source book project in the works that hadn't been released yet, but the previews look lovely

## Parts of books put on hold for now

ESLII
* Fancy math about shrinkage and selectors: p84-100
