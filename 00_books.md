# Courses, books and links

## Courses

* [Stanford, linear dynamical systems](http://stanford.edu/class/ee363/lectures.html) (Stephen Boyd) - includes stochastic control, Kalman filter, Lyapunov theory
* That course on reinforcement learning - find the link
* [Matrix methods in data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx5Z-OslNWE&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k) - YouTube from MIT. Not my first choice, but may be good for refreshing things.

## Books

* VLMS - 19 chapters
* MML - 12 chapters
* Kuhn Johnson - 20 chapters
* ESLII - 18 chapters
* Algorithms bhy Sedgewick - about 30 small chapters
* Cracking the code interview - 17 chapters + general info

Above books are about 100 chapters in total total. Or about 3 months worth of time if one faithfully studies a chapter a day.

Second priority books:

* Deep larning by Ian Goodfellow et al ([full pdf](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/))
* Pattern recognition and ML by Christopher Bishop ([full pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/))
* Foundations of ML by M. Mohri et al ([full pdf](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/)) - more mathy?
* ML book by K.P. Murphy - [page](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) (but no full pdf)

Third priority books:

* Algorithms by Erickson - 12 long chapters

Books that are currently not on the reading list, but still who knows:

* Problem solving with data structures in Python ([full text, web](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html))

## Aggregators of links

* [Machine learning for humans, 80/20 reading list](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/ai-reading-list-c4753afd97a) - claims to be curated. Sections on ML, Deep, RL, and then various general readings about the meaning of it all.
