Look through, decide the priority, and how to file.

Interesting practical intro to ML projects; look through:

## Books
Currently at: ESL p139 (Basis expansion)

(Given in subjective order of my gradual reading)
* How to think like a computer scientist by Allen B. Downey: ([site](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)) - best intro to Python ever
* VLMS (Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra) by Stephen Boyd. [full pdf](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/)
* Algorithms by Sedgewick - uses Java, but is exceptionally clearly written
* ESL (The Elements of Statistical Learning) by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman. ([full pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)) Very extensive, no code, most math is stated but not derived, poor exposition. If I could go back in time, I'd bumped ISLR and "Hands-On ML in Python" to this position, and moved ESL to the "Deeper Refresher" section ([ref](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-the-book-Elements-of-Statistical-Learning-What-books-materials-would-help-beef-up-my-foundations-so-that-I-will-be-able-to-comprehend-the-book-easily)). It's probably a great book to revisit and integrate the material you already know.
* "The 100 pages ML book" by Andriy Burkov. [full pdf](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php) 
* Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow et al. [full pdf](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* Programming in Python: Fluent Python, by Luciano Ramalho (no online version)
* MML (Mathematics for Machine Learning) by M.P. Deisenroth: [full pdf](https://mml-book.github.io/)
* Hands-On M with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, by Aurélien Géron. Python obviously. [All labs on github](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2), but no full version of the book online.

Second priority books:
* On Programming Well, by Robert C. Martin (no online version)
* Pattern recognition and ML by Christopher Bishop ([full pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/)) - apparently, has a more Bayesian perspective
* [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/) - an interactive introduction to deep learning, based on NumPy, apparently (no TF, no PyTorch, ha! Is it true?) 
* Think Complexity, by Allen B. Downey ([full pdf](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity-2e/)) - network sci, automata, all in Python
* Foundations of ML by M. Mohri et al ([full pdf](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/)) - more mathy?
* ML book by K.P. Murphy - ([site](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/), but no full pdf)
* Morgan, S. L., & Winship, C. (2015). Counterfactuals and causal inference (pdfs are googlable)
* [Notes on dynamical systems](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~macpd/ads/) ([pdf](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~macpd/ads/bnotes.pdf)) from Carl Dettmann. Not a textbook, but close; worth scanning
* Bayesian Statistics: Statistical Rethinking, by Richard McElreath
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, by Russel and Norvig. ([site](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/), but no online)

Refresher books
* ISLR: Introduction to Statistical Learning with R, by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani - seems like a more practical and simpler version of ESLII? ([web with pdf](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)). There are some fan-made translations of the code from R to Python: [JW](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python).
* Applied Predictive Modeling by Kuhn Johnson (no free pdf online). Code in R.

Third priority books:
* Algorithms by Erickson
* Design Patterns for Python by Norvig: https://norvig.com/design-patterns/

Books that are not on my reading list, but keeping here just in case:
* Problem solving with data structures in Python ([full text, web](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html))
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Nielsen
* Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen: [pdf](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) (C++) - great idea, but the descriptions of algorithms are not clear, while implementations seem ideosyncratic (or maybe not; maybe I )

Links for the computation course I'm teaching this spring:
* Modeling and Simulation in Python, by Allen B. Downey: [link](https://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/)
* Examples of good student projects from Downey's course: [1](https://github.com/kdy304g/ComplexLizards-CA/blob/master/reports/final_report.md), [2](https://github.com/jzerez/swarm_classification/blob/master/reports/Final_Report.md)

Job-search specific books:
* Cracking the code interview
* [[Huyen2019book]] - a short book on data science / ML job interviewing

## Courses
* [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) - a really good introduction for complete noobs 
* [Stanford, linear dynamical systems](http://stanford.edu/class/ee363/lectures.html) (Stephen Boyd) - includes stochastic control, Kalman filter, Lyapunov theory
* [Linear algebra by Gilbert Strang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) - Youtube from MIT. Everybody loves it, as it achieves a beautiful balance between staying extremely practical, concise, but at the same time giving many proofs (or "almost proofs", extreme-physics style, like for good cases, with simplifying assumptions etc). MIT also has [notes for each lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/syllabus/) (not in one pdf, but easy to find).
* [Matrix methods in data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx5Z-OslNWE&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k) (also Gilbert Strang)- YouTube from MIT. May be good for refreshing things.
* [Maximum Entropy Network Ensembles](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~gbianconi/LTCCModule) - a series of lectures
* [End-to-end machine learning](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com) - sorta like a course from Brandon Rohrer

## Aggregators of links

* [A very nice annotated list of book recommendations](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-the-mooc-a-bookworms-guide-to-data-science-e87271cb0572)
* [Machine learning for humans, 80/20 reading list](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/ai-reading-list-c4753afd97a) - claims to be curated. Sections on ML, Deep, RL, and then various general readings about the meaning of it all.
* [Scientific visualization with matplotlib](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book) - an open-source book project in the works that hadn't been released yet, but the previews look lovely
