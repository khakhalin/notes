SiLU has a become a part of an interesting "natural experiment" in the world of scientific publishing. SiLU was originally proposed by one group, and the paper was rejected form a conference. It was also put on arxiv, but went unnoticed. Later, the same activation function was published by Google, accepted into a conference, and popularized. While the original press called it Swish, eventually (becuase of arxiv preprint) the priority was established, and all major packages (TF, PyTorch) called their objects for this activation function SiLU, and not Swish.
