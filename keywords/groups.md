**Dihedral group**: symmetries of a regular polygon. Denoted Dih_n or D_2n. Has a size of 2n (n rotations + the same number of flipped rotations). ab denotes rotation b followed by rotation a. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group

Related: **Octahedral group**, aka **Cube group**. Quite complicated. I think it's also known as S_4, but not sure. Gosh, it's really complicated! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedral_symmetry 48 elements, 98 subgroups, and like 50 different weird ways to visualize it: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Full_octahedral_group

**Symmetric group**: a group of permutations length n. Has n! elements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group

Ways to describe a group:
* **Cayley table**: a multiplication table for a group. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_table)
* **Cycle graph**: use various elements of a group as generating elements, and draw the cycles that arise. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph_(algebra)
* **Cayley graph**: each element is a vertex, each generator is a color of an edge, vertices are connected if a generator can transform from one node to another. Note that for a given group, it depends on a choice of a generator. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph
