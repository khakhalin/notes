# Waiting time paradox

#probability

A type of **observation bias**. If there's a distribution of intervals (between buses), and you arrive at a bus stop at a random moment of time, your average waiting time will be > than the average interval between the buses. That's because you are more likely to arrive during a longer interval, which introduces a sampling bias.
