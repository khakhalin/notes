There appears to be several ways to build a hierarchy of business indicators. One of them (a rather simple one) starts like that:

* Gross Sales = Gross Revenue = what your customers paid you, for this time period
* Net Sales = Neet Revenue = Gross Sales – (discounts + refunds) 
    * What's the deal with VAT?
    * What's the deal with time allocation? Generated vs billed vs payed? * 
* Gross profit = Net Sales – Cost of goods sold
* EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) = Gross Profit – Marketing, general, and administrative expenses
* Operating profit = Gross profit – OPEX (operating expense) = EBITDA – Depreciation and amortization
* EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes) = Operationg profit + Non-operating sources of income
* EBT (Earnings before taxes) = EBIT + interest (this interst may be positive if you lend money, or negative if you borrowed it)
* Net income = EBT - Taxes 

A fancier approach replaces the sequence from Revenue to EBIT with a battery of contribution margins:
* CM1 (Contribution Margin 1) = Net Revenue – variable costs (costs associated with the process of delivering the service)
* CM2 = CM1 – Product fixed costs (the costs you bear regardless of whether you sell anything or not, such as the costs of holding the equipment that you use to deliver the services)
* CM3 = CM2 – Group fixed cost. This last one is only important for huge organizations with a portfolio of very different products, where they want to estimate the financials of each group of products separately.

So the CM1 sequnce kinda removes expenses in a different order. From an accounting point of view it makes sense to remove operation expenses (including all overhead) first, as this is live money (cashflow), and then remove amortizaton and depreciation (as these are paid at some random moment, and then spread across the entire period). But from the per product or per market profability analysis, it makes sense remove the investments in this product or market first, to estimate the marginal effect from potentially getting rid of this market, and only then apply fixed overheads (the organization / techstack).

There are also some non-GAAP measures that are often used in performance reporting to investors etc:
* Adjusted EBITDA: something like a reconciliation that tries to model the performance of a company as it "would have been", in the absence of financial effects that supposedly don't characterize the performance of the company, but are kinda extraneous. You calculate it in the opposite direction, not from the cashflow down, but from the official Net income up, only including those taxes, intersts, amortizations and changes in the capital that are relevant for the performance of the company.
