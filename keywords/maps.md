# World / Europe

Nice interactive population density map: https://luminocity3d.org/WorldPopDen/#9/52.1183/5.1334
(Works well for Europe, although Poland seems to be full of weird artifacts)

For any rail station, a map of stations that can be reached from it directly (without changing a train)

Air quality map. Can zoom on individual cities. The higher the value of AQI - the _worse_ is the air. Seems to have a weird property that to preserve correct average value, and knowing that streeets are bad, it surrounds every street with a halo of "better than average air" that kidna doesn't make much sense necessarily. So big cities look better than the countryside (?): https://air.plumelabs.com/Berlin-air-quality-map-cntd

Biking map (based on OSM, but with really good color scheme that clearly shows biking infrastructure)
