Studied bats flying in a hangar (so 3D navigation?). Each place cell responded to many spaces, and interestingly, some of these "place fields" (place fields = a spatial generalization of receptive fields) are really large, and some are really small. For the same cell. But a combination of which cells are active and which are not form a multiscale sparse code.
