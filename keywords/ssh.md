Public key goes to the machine you're connecting to; private key is stored locally. All of them are typically stored in the `.ssh` hidden folder in the main folder (user's root, aka `~`).

Some usage profiles:
`ssh username@ip` - connect to that machine
`ssh -i path/custom_private_key username@ip` - connect using a custom key

To generate new keys (a pair of public and private keys), use `ssh-keygen -o -f path/file_name`. (ðŸ”¥  _Not sure the keys are correct. Before using, actually google, as there are different standards for these keys, and some are newer than the other_)

# Secure file copy

`scp source_file username@ip:path` - secure copy to a remote machine. It is kinda similar to`cp`, but secure. It can also take same keys as `ssh`, like `-i` for example. 

The `:path` at the end of the "target" part seems to be required; it doesn't default to anything, and if you forget to add it, it just "thinks" that your `username@ip` was a cute name for a new folder, and creates this folder, locally.

If it complains, it failed. If it's silent, it also probabl yfailed. When it's successful, it echos to the terminal the name of the file that was copied.

# With version control

To use [[git]] tools (like [[gitlab]] for example), and assuming that you use different keys for different purposes, you'll need to cpecify which key to use for which host. Create `~/.ssh/config` file, and write to it something like:
```
Host gitlab.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab_com_rsa
```
