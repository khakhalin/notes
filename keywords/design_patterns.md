A famous programming paradigm, and a name of a famous book (1994) by Peter Norwig, about optimized, standardized ways to design interactions between classes and objects in object-oriented programming. About 23 or so archetypical solutions and interfaces that software engineers learn by heart. Also aids with refactoring (minimizes, structures, and ideally - eliminates it). Also facilitates interactions between developers (a common vocab).

Of these ~23, some are obscure, but some are really important. The short list:
* Factory
* Builder
* Prototype
* Singleton
* Strategy
* Observer
* Adapter
* Model view Controller
* Inversion of Control
* Chain of Responsibility
* Decorator
* Iterator
* Command
