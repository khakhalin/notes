Parent: [[personality]]

A famous classification of people, based on the an introspective questionnaire. Decidedly Jungian; proposed around 1919. Almost all research in support of it is produced by the Myers-Briggs foundation, and published in their own journal. Sometimes called "the worst psych test in existence"; poor validity (doesn't measure what it claims to measure), but perhaps more importantly - poor reliability (doesn't replicate within the same person over time). Misses important traits that were later discovered to be stable (neroticism from Big5 - see [[ocean-model]]), and has it's purported "coordinates" non-orthogonal (stronly correlated in real populations).

Proposed coordinates:
* E/I - Extraverstion to Introversion - Modestly (0.7) correlates with Extraversion from Big5, but also Neuroticism
* S/N - Sensing to Intuition - Modestly (0.7) correlates with Openness from Big5
* T/F - Thinking to Feeling - Weak correlation (0.5) with Agreebleness but also Extraversion
* J/P - Judging to Perceiving - Weak correlation with like 3 different columns in Big5
