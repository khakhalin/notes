# Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

Parent: [[personality]]

A famous classification of people, based on the an introspective questionnaire. Decidedly Jungian; proposed around 1919. Almost all research in support of it is produced by the Myers-Briggs foundation, and published in their own journal. Because it's a for-profit test (about 20M/Y revenue, apparently. Still used in business, and by the US military).

Sometimes called "the worst psych test in existence"; poor validity (doesn't measure what it claims to measure), but perhaps more importantly - poor reliability (doesn't replicate within the same person over time). Misses important traits that were later discovered to be stable (neroticism from Big5 - see [[ocean-model]]), and has it's purported "coordinates" non-orthogonal (stronly correlated in real populations). And doesn't predict things that well.

Proposed coordinates (and how they relate to better measures from the [[ocean-model]])
* E/I - Extraversion to Introversion - Modestly (0.7) correlates with Extraversion from Big5, but also Neuroticism
* S/N - Sensing to Intuition - Modestly (0.7) correlates with Openness from Big5
* T/F - Thinking to Feeling - Weak correlation (0.5) with Agreebleness but also Extraversion
* J/P - Judging to Perceiving - Weak correlation with like 3 different columns in Big5

One interesting point: all states on this chart feel good (neither of them feels like an inherently bad thing), which would have been really nice, if it were true, but we also kinda know from experience that there are objectively unpleasant, harmful, toxic peopleâ€¦ Which kinda suggests that this test won't cover them. Which means that either the test is incomplete, or it bends the axes. (That's because it's a commercial test, it is designed to be "feel-good")

Interesting lecture (by Cameron Brick) that covers Myers-Briggs among other things (about 30 min in), and does it well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km_5RUfbt8c
