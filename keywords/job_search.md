# Cover letter

* A good trick is to pretend you’re explaining to a friend why you’re excited about the job and think you’d be great at it. You probably wouldn’t stiffly recite your work history; you’d probably talk about what you’re good at and how you’d approach the work. ([source](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/06/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-that-will-help-you-get-an-interview.html))
* If you’re overqualified for the position, make a point of acknowledging it and explaining why you’re interested in the job anyway. If you’re currently living across the country from where the position is located but have plans to move there soon, mention that. If all your experience is in a different industry but you’re actively working to transition into this one, explain that and talk about why. (ibid)
