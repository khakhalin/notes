# Coding interviews

**General advice:**
* Always ask **clarification** questions! At least in the past, Google would intentionally design questions to be vague, with some core assumptions undisclosed, and left for the candidate to "discover" through follow-up questions. They were arguing that it models real life, where you always perform research to better understand the problem before attempting to solve it.
* **Verbalize your half-thoughts** in full sentences, as if explaining it to someone. Even hunches that are tempting, but that you decide to abandon immediately, are better to be cast into full sentences. Speak slowly, don't try to catch up with your thinking. It's actually more important to show your thinking than to solve the problem in the best possible way.
* Before coding (if coding in a shared online system), create a comment block with  """ and write a **simple-language algorithm sketch** (not even pseudocode, but really just a sketch). Then pick at least one example (test case or two), and **trace** it through the algorithm. As if explaining, teaching the algorithm to the interviewer.
* If you need to interpret the task creatively (say, to decide what to return in weird edge cases?) - make sure to talk it through. Maybe outline several options, or sketch it down. It is also a type of an implicit follow-up question; give the interviewer a chance to comment on your thinking, if needed.
* **Always try 2-3 solutions**, don’t just settle on one. Write it down, but then explore other options, to see how your first idea compares to them.
* Many places like to gradually make the task more complex as they go (which is a very good practice, see [[recruiting]]). They may also ask you to refactor the code at some point. That's normal and good!
* In the past, when people used to interview in-person, it was recommended to practice to physically write code on a white board, as it is a weird experimence.

## Former academics

Break the stereotype of a "non-doer" / impractical perfectionist that many people have about academia.

For first-timers, only about to leave academia:
* On resume, put a stress on practical technologists that academics almost never know: business thinking (monetary impact, measurable process improvements); industry tools AWS, Docker, cloud solutions
* Organize remote industry collaborations; hunt for some recent non-academic achievements to put on your resume. Make it the top line, above the academic job, as "consulting" or "personal projects". Break the stigma!
* Kaggle: no need to win, but show that can do stuff that works

If asked about Python proficiency for a solid ex-academic, answer 7/10 or 8/10; or "confidently proficient, but lacking production quality professional experience". Academics tend to _severely_ undervalue themselves, and their expertise, because of years of self-doubt and institutionalized abuse. Academics leaving academia are also a self-selected buncch, more likely to have experienced a multiyear toxic relationship with their institutions.

# Cover letter

* A good trick is to pretend you’re explaining to a friend why you’re excited about the job and think you’d be great at it. You probably wouldn’t just stiffly recite your work history; you’d probably talk about what you’re particularly good at and how you’d apply it to the work at this new place.
* If you’re overqualified for the position, make a point of acknowledging it and explaining why you’re interested in the job anyway. If you’re currently living across the country from where the position is located but have plans to move there soon, mention that. If all your experience is in a different industry but you’re actively working to transition into this one, explain that and talk about why.

In the era of ChatGPT, the shorter and to-the point the cover-letter, the better. No need for boilerplate, cut to the chase. Make it short, personal, informative, and decisive. No platitudes.
