# Resumes and cover letters

* A good trick is to pretend you’re explaining to a friend why you’re excited about the job and think you’d be great at it. You probably wouldn’t stiffly recite your work history; you’d probably talk about what you’re good at and how you’d approach the work. ([source](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/06/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-that-will-help-you-get-an-interview.html))
* If you’re overqualified for the position, make a point of acknowledging it and explaining why you’re interested in the job anyway. If you’re currently living across the country from where the position is located but have plans to move there soon, mention that. If all your experience is in a different industry but you’re actively working to transition into this one, explain that and talk about why. (ibid)

# Advice for former academics

Main point: break the stereotype of a "non-doer" that many people have about academia. Ways to do it, before the first job:

* Accent on practical technologists that academics almost never know: AWS, Docker, other cloud solutions
* Remote industry collaborations, internships of sort, to place on the CV?
* Kaggle: no need to win, but show that can do stuff that works
