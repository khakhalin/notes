**General advice:**
* Always ask **clarification** questions! Google (at least) intentionally designs questions to be **vague**, with some core assumptions undisclosed, so you need to ask. They are trying to model real life, where you always perform research to better understand the problem before attempting to solve it.
* Before coding (if coding in a shared online system), create a comment block with  """ and write a **simple-language algo sketch** in it (not even pseudocode necessarily). Then pick at least one **example** (test case; maybe 2), and **trace** it through the algorithm. As if explaining, teaching the algorithm to the interviewer.
* If you need to interpret the task creatively  (say, what to return in weird edge cases?) - make sure to **talk it through**. Maybe outline several options, and even sketch it down in writing?
* **Always try 2-3 solutions**, don’t just settle on one. Write it down, but then explore other options, to see how your first idea compares to them.
* **Verbalize your half-thoughts** in full sentences, as if explaining it to someone. Even hunches that are tempting, but that you decide to abandon immediately, a better to be cast into full sentences. Speak slowly, don't try to catch up with your thinking. It's actually more important to show your thinking than to solve the problem in the best possible way.
* Many places like to gradually make the task more complex as they go. They may also ask you to refactor the code at some point. That's normal and good.
* Practice to physically write code on a white board.
* When working online, in an environment that can run the code, ask the interviewer if they would prefer you to run the code, or if they want you to trace it and troubleshoot it verbally first.

# Cover letter

* A good trick is to pretend you’re explaining to a friend why you’re excited about the job and think you’d be great at it. You probably wouldn’t just stiffly recite your work history; you’d probably talk about what you’re particularly good at and how you’d apply it to the work at this new place. ([source](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/06/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-that-will-help-you-get-an-interview.html))
* If you’re overqualified for the position, make a point of acknowledging it and explaining why you’re interested in the job anyway. If you’re currently living across the country from where the position is located but have plans to move there soon, mention that. If all your experience is in a different industry but you’re actively working to transition into this one, explain that and talk about why. (ibid)

Useful wording and nuggets:
* A reasonable starting salary for a mid-level DS in NYC is 120 (maybe as high as 140 least as an ask); maybe as low as 100 if it's a strategic choice for some strategic reasons. But not lower.
* Python proficiency for a solid ex-academic: 7/10 or 8/10; or "confidently proficient, but lacking production quality professional experience".

# Resume

# Advice for former academics

Main point: break the stereotype of a "non-doer" that many people have about academia. Ways to do it, before the first job:

* Accent on practical technologists that academics almost never know: AWS, Docker, other cloud solutions
* Remote industry collaborations, internships of sort, to place on the CV?
* Kaggle: no need to win, but show that can do stuff that works
