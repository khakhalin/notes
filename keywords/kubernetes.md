Kubertnetes is an open-source system (originally developed by Google) for coordinating [[docker]] containers on the cloud (something that is called **orchestration**). It operates **pods** that each contains several **containers**, that are placed together, within the same localhost. Pods can communicate with each other via pod IP. Kubernetes distributed containers across pods and also **nodes** (physical machines), allocates resources to them, automatically restart them if they fail, make sure that there's more than one instance of those containers that need to run in duplicate, and maintain load balancing across instances (see [[system_design]]).

First log in to [[aws]].

To see what pods are running: `kubectl get pods`. Also shows pod age, and the number of instances.

To see logs (those produced by a logger): `kubectl logs specific_pod_name`, where the name can be taken from the pods list above. Note that the name in the pods list has a constant part (the beginning), and a unique part (the end) that is different for different instances, and changes when the pod restarts (?). For the log command you need the full version of the name (constant and variable), as you want to see logs of a particular instance of a pod. For some other commands below you only need the constant part, as you are scaling the number of pods, not a specific instance. (ðŸ”¥ not sure the terminology is correct here)

If the pod fails, you can try to summarize the reasons with `kubectl describe pods my_pod_name`

ssh into pod: `kubectl exec -it pod_name /bin/sh`

Restart pod: `kubectl delete pods pod_name`. It deletes it indeed, but then kubernetes immediately restarts it.

Turn off a pod: `kubectl scale deploy pod_name --replicas=0`
