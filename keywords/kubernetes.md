Kubertnetes is an open-source system (originally developed by Google) for coordinating [[docker]] containers on the cloud (something that is called **orchestration**). It operates **pods** that each contains several **containers**, that are placed together, within the same localhost. Pods can communicate with each other via pod IP. Kubernetes distributed containers across pods and also **nodes** (physical machines), allocates resources to them, automatically restart them if they fail, make sure that there's more than one instance of those containers that need to run in duplicate, and maintain load balancing across instances (see [[system_design]]).

First log in to [[aws]]. ðŸ”¥

`kubectl get pods` - See what pods are running. Also shows pod age, and the number of instances for each pod. Note that at least in some cases (ðŸ”¥ when?) kubernetes actually orchestrates the number of instances via a different mechanism, so it seems like all pods have only one instance, but actually they all look a bit like `meaningful_name-sd8fs-s8df8s0df98`, so some "generic name", followed by a hash-like autogenerated code that turns it into a "precise name". I'm not yet sure how it works exactly ðŸ”¥ , but it seems that some commands take a generic name, while some need a precise name (or maybe all names are "equipped" with a trailing wildcard at interpretation stage? ðŸ”¥ not sure)

`kubectl logs specific_pod_name` - See logs (those produced by a logger). The pod name can be taken from the pods list above. Note that the name in the pods list has a constant part (the beginning), and a unique part (the end) that is different for different instances, and changes when the pod restarts (?). For the log command you need the full version of the name (constant and variable), as you want to see logs of a particular instance of a pod. For some other commands below you only need the constant part, as you are scaling the number of pods, not a specific instance. (ðŸ”¥ not sure the terminology is correct here)

If a pod fails, you can try to summarize the reasons with `kubectl describe pods my_pod_name`

ssh into pod: `kubectl exec -it pod_name /bin/sh`
> (Except kubctl says this format is deprecated, and one should type it differently??
`kubectl exec [POD] [COMMAND] is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version. Use kubectl exec [POD] -- [COMMAND] instead.` ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ )

One useful reason to ssh into the pod is to see the values of hidden secret encoded environmental variables if they are mentioned in the code as `os.environ['MY_TABLE']` constants. Which is typical, as you want to keep them as env variables so that you could run the same code in different environments (dev / int / prod), and for security reasons they may be obfuscated (aka "sealed-secrets" ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)

Restart pod: `kubectl delete pods pod_name_precise`. It deletes it indeed, but then kubernetes immediately restarts it. The name needs to be a precise one (?ðŸ”¥ ) as you're killing an instance.

Turn off a pod: `kubectl scale deploy pod_name_generic --replicas=0`. This is a cool not-quite-destructive operation, as the pod stil remains deployed, it just no longer has any running instances. Which means that doing `kubectl scale depoly pod_name --replicas=2` can bring instances back (2 instances in this case). Scaling down from 2 to 1 or vice versa may also be helpful sometimes (during troubleshooting, de-[[gridlock]]ing etc.). Note also that keys can go in any order (useful when manually rescaling several pods at once). ðŸ”¥ _is there an even more automated command for scaling down all pods, or all pods by one, or something like that?_

# Other tools

Apparently some people vouch by the k9s tool as the best possible interface to kubernetes: https://k9scli.io/topics/commands/
