In humans, interesting facts (find refs when have time)
* Laterality and dyslexia, autism
* Laterality and aggression, population-level. Fighter hypothesis

Most (all?) non-human species don't have species level laterality, only individual-level:

**Corvids**
Clary, D., Cheys, A., & Kelly, D. M. (2014). Pattern of visuospatial lateralization in two corvid species, black-billed magpies and Clark's nutcrackers. Behavioural processes, 107, 94-98. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25130753/

**Tadpoles**
Wassersug RJ, Yamashita M. (2002) Assessing and interpreting lateralised behaviours in anuran larvae  Laterality
Full text is not available (but I have it). They claim that in both T-mases and in startle responses each particular tadpole has a 60-90% preference towards either left or right, while there's no preference at the population level. Is lost during metamorphosis. They link to the direction it was curved in the egg, or to the side it layed on in the bowl, or assymmetry of M-cells (with refs).
