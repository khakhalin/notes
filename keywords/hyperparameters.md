When people say "Hyperparameters", they usually mean:
* the number of training epochs
* batch size
* [[optimizers]], including the learning rate
* [[regularization]] (type and amount), such as L1, L2, dropout, weight decay
* training / validation split
* weght init (distribution)

Gray zone 1: Hyperparameters that are almost network architecture ( [[archsearch]] )
* the number of layers
* the width and depth of layers
* convolution window size, window stride and optional
* layer-level transformations, such as layer normalization

Gray zone 2: Aspects of training regime:
* Any pre-training / warm-up?
* Any Fine-tuning? Which layers are frozen during pre-turning?


# General ideas

There are several main **strategies** for optimization: manual, random, grid, optimized (e.g. Bayesian). Essentially, like minimization on top of minimization. An curious idea is that what approach is better may depend on when (within your project) you're doing it: if you're doing it late, it may be better to use some out-of-the box Bayesian method, but if you're doing it early, it may be more beneficial to do a grid-like search, to get a feeling for the whole minimization landscape.

Iterative Sweeps may be a reasonable strategy (Svetlichnaya 2020), where you go from more obvious parameters to less obvious ones, fixing all but one at each stage, and retaining the best configuration. A logical sequence: optimizer → order of magnitude for learning rate → layer sizes and convolution depth (aka filters) → dropout → all the fancy stuff.

# Batch size

**Mini-batch**: process >1 (usually 10-1000) points at a time. Somewhere in between fully stochastic descent (1 point at a time) and classic regression (all points every time).

What is the **optimal batch size**? The downside of small batches (in the extreme case - fully stochastic descent) is that it's slow (as by definition it's not parallel). The benefit is that it makes a trajectory weirder that may help to avoid narrow minima (overfitting). _Is it true? Did I understand it right? I'm not sure._ On the other hand, with larger batch sizes, you can get a boost in speed. The net effect of batch size $b$ per computation is a sqrt(b) increase in time (hurt), as you do b times more calculations, but everything converges sqrt(b) times faster. But it can be parallelized, so for reasonably small b, it leads to a net improvement. And another effect, for high b descent is very smooth, which may make the model trapped at sharp minima. Seems to be related to the idea of "temperature" for optimization.
