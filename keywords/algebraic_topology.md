# Simplex

**K-simplex**: an all-to-all graph of k+1 points; or rather, technically, this graph with all higher-order realities; not just edges, but **faces** etc.
0. 0-simlplex = a point
1. 1-simplex = 2 points + 1 edge
2. 2-simplex = 3 points + 3 edges + 1 face
3. 3-simplex = 4 points + 6 edges + 4 faces + 1 tetrahedric volume, etc.

**Simplicial complex**: a bunch of simplices glued together along **faces** (so not just nodes or edges, but faces at least).
