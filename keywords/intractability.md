# Intractability
#meaning #bib

An interesting concept about behaviors that I don't yet understand fully. The general idea seems to be that optimal behaviors are intractable (it is impossible to fully prove that a ceretain behavior is optimal?), so cognitive scientists are often tempted to "off-load" the emergence of behavior to evolution. But evolution, as just another search algorithm, does not solve the problem: the same way as it is impossible to find an optimal behavior cognitively, it is impossible to find it through evolutionary search.

Sounds interesting, but vague.
