A general word for non-relational databases: not tabular-based, good for realtime big data. May work with documents, key-values, wide-columns, graphs. Have lower guarantees on consistency (stale reads: updates don't update immediately), which can lead to data loss.

These days storage has become cheaper than computing power, so SQL (that optimizes storage, but is computationally expensive) was partially replaced by noSQL (that is bulky, but simpler). SQL joins are expensive.
