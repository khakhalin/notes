# Likert scale

#stats #psych

For questionnaries. Classic 5 points: Strongly disagree - Disagree - Neither agree nor disagree - Agree - Strongly agree. Sometimes, to force an opinion, the middle point is absent.

Potential pitfalls:
* People may avoid expressing a strong opinion
* May tend to agree with statements as present (especially strong with children, elderly)
* May self-judge, and/or strategize (fake good, fake bad)

Technically the data is ordinal, but two assumptions may help to analyze it as interval:
* An assumption that all steps are equidistant
* That middle is in the middle (symmetric)

Good test: Wilcoxon signed-rank, or some modification of it
