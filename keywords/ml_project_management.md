Basic ideas:
1. Define scope, feasibility, targets (accuracy, speed, size?)
2. Define ground truth
3. Validate data, swim in it, write data tests upfront.
4. Version your data
5. Identify baselines (stupid / simplistic models). Fit and overfit with them
7. Is there a SoTA model?
8. Start very simple (aka "Don't be a hero")
9. Develop model by iterating through a cycle ([ref](http://josh-tobin.com/assets/pdf/troubleshooting-deep-neural-networks-01-19.pdf)): 
        * add complexity; 
        * debug; 
        * tune hyperparameters, 
        * benchmark
10. Test on test data
11. Write tests for model performance (to be alerted if it unexpectedly drops on new data)

How to fight bad fit:
* Underfitting: bigger model (increase model capacity); less regularization; advanced architecture; tune hyperparameters; add more features
* Overfitting: more training data; regularization; data augmentation; reduce model size

Interesting point: in ML research, one kinda cannot afford to skip hyperparater tuning and data augmentation, as many changes to standard approaches that are supposedly helpful, may in fact just be bad proxies for either regularization, or augmentation. So these additional "degrees of freedom" should be saturated (good regularization, good data augmentation) for both "control" and "newly developed" methods, to make comparisons fair.
