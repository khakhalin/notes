# Dual basis
#linalg

**Dual space** (V*) for a space V, is defined as a space of all linear functionals f:V→ℝ. 

**Dual basis** is a basis in this space, such that if e_i ∈ basis of V, and f_j ∈ V*, then f_j(e_i) = δ_ij (is only ==1 if i=j, and is 0 otherwise).

Now, f(a1e1 +a2e2) = a1f(e1) + a2f(e2), so f(v) is equivalent to ⟨b,v⟩ where b_i = f(e_i). And for an orthonormal basis {e_i}, b_i = e_i. _Right?_
