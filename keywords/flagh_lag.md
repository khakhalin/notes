https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_lag_illusion

The one that shows that our visual system is "adapted" to our slow neural processing, and so extrapolates the position of smoothly moving objects, or otherwise we wouldn't have been able to catch up.

The reaction time to a simple presence of light is about 150 ms, of which ~50 ms is pure processing. In fast sports like tennis, it's ~0.5 m difference between ball position, and the part that we are processing.

#halfthere - what are the actual delays?
