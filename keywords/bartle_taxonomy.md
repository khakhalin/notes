Proposed in 1996, based on their preferred **actions** (note: not motivations or values!!) within the game (originally, MUDs and online RPGs). Overall, set the ground and the narrative, but at this point seems to be completely replaced with other methodologies, even though none of them seem to be dominant at the moment.

1. Killers
2. Achievers
3. Socializers
4. Explorers

These four form a 2D plot, with social/world focus as one axis, and action/experience as the other axis. They also used card suits to mark these 4 quadrants. The test used to be available online.

Interesting criticism: that "explore" means very different things for exploring the world, and exploring the game mechanic (kinda like Mel / Vorthos dichotomy in mtg, right?), and apparently irl these two interests don't even correlate.

That "exploring" means 2 very different things:
