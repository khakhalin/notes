# Singular Value Decomposition, or SVD

Parents: [[linalg]]

A = UDV, where U and V are unitary (orthonormal, may be complex), and D is diagonal with d_ii ∈ R, d_ii>0. Dimensions: mn = mm∙mn∙nn. More general than spectral decomposition, as applies to all matrices on C, unlike QDQᵀ that only works for symmetic, or a slightly more general PDP⁻¹ for diagonalizable (sum dim eigenspaces = dim A).
