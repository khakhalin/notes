In development since 1943. Updated and restructured several times. Can be projected onto many different scales, most corresponding to typical clinical problems in mental health (such as anxiety, depression, etc.) Also a bunch of "validity scales", to detect "faking bad", "faking good", overall inconsistency, overreporting clinical presentations etc. 567 true/false questions (in MMPI-2 version).

Appears to be not cross-culturally comparable (see [[cultural_differences]]), as even white / black people in the US seem to process these questions a bit differently.
