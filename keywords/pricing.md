Three main models of pricing:
1. **Cost-based** (aka Cost-plus pricing)
    * Simple to calcualte
    * Guaranteed to be profitable
    * Doesn't guarantee best profit (ignores demand)
    * Customers tend to love them, if you explain them
    * Some costs are really hard to make transparent tho
3. **Value-based**, aka a price customers are willing to pay for the _value_ the product brings them
    * Measuring the "true value" is time- and resource-consuming
    * But unike some other approaches, if done properly, by definition supports good product image (as you are trying to figure out what customers want)
    * Allows optimization per customer group (segmentation)
    * Is sensitive to competition, marketing efforts
5. **Competition-based**
    * In competitive markets, pricing becomes a part of branding
    * May be unprofitable
    * Needs constant monitoring
    * But too much monitoring may lead to weird dynamic effects, like run-away prices

Other effects:
* **Charm pricing** (aka "just below" aka "price ending"): 9.99 sells way better than 10.0 . About 60-70% of all prices we experience are in practice "charmed" (9 is the last digit). Interestingly, it's still controversial how exactly they work.
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_pricing
* Conjoint analysis - in focus groups, ask questions in which features / properties of a product are varied, and measure how different features and their combinations are valued by customers
* Pricing as signaling to the customer
* Known pricing as social signaling to other people
* Moral component (is it perceived as a good thing to do?)
* Customer churn
* Conversion rates (new customers) and conversion costs. One can compare conversion cost to lifetime value of a customer (assuming a given churn rate)
* Segmentation (acrosss products, subscription plans etc.)
* Brand image and brand erosion
* Longer subscriptions are cheaper because of 1) customer commitment, habit, 2) cashflow improvements for us that we can share, 3) operational savings for us that we can share. Typical discounts yearly vs monthly - 10-20%
