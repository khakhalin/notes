Three main models:
1. **Cost-based**
    * Simple to calcualte
    * Guaranteed to be profitable
    * Doesn't guarantee best profit (ignores demand)
    * Customers tend to love them, if you explain them
    * Some costs are really hard to make transparent
3. **Value-based**, aka a price customers are willing to pay
    * Time- and resource-consuming
    * If done properly, by definition supports product image (as you are trying to figure out what customers want)
    * Allows optimization per customer group
    * Is sensitive to competition, marketing efforts
5. **Competition-based**
    * In competitive markets, pricing becomes a part of branding
    * May be unprofitable
    * Needs constant monitoring
    * But too much monitoring may lead to weird dynamic effects, like run-away prices
