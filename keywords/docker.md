# Docker and Containerization

Parent: [[01_Tools]]

#tools


Computing service (cloud service) that provides a platform with OS-level virtualization: an isolated user space (called a **container**) that looks like a dedicated computer to programs running on it. Containers can talk to each other via defined channels. But unlike virtual machines, there's only one OS, so is less resource-hungry.

The software is called **Docker Engine**. Typically on a single engine an engine can ran 8-16 containers.
