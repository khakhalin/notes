# Receptors

**Salt**: Na is detected by ENaC, which is Na-specific, and doesn't respond to other ions, or to negative ions. So Na salts are salty. For example, MSG is monoSodium glutamate, and yep, it's also salty, not just umami. Even tho it doesn't have Cl-.

On the other hand, KCl is both bitter (K) and salty (Cl-), with subjective saltiness of about 0.6, compared to NaCl. That's because Cl- is also detected as "salt", by a different receptor. I'm not sure if the molecular identity of this receptor is known though (in 2016 it was yet unknown):

# Tongue maps

There are differences actually; they are just not as profound as people used to claim :)

It's a kind of a "Russian doll" of two myths at this point. First, in 1901 a German dude named Dirk Hänig published a paper in which he stated that different parts of tongue have different (higher or lower) _sensitivity_ to different tastes. Then people started reposting and retweeting his findings (back then it was called "publishing", I think), and with each repost the claims become increasingly more extreme. By late-20-century textbooks claimed that different parts of the tongue are "responsible" for different tastes. So in 1974 Virginia Collings tested whether it's true, and pretty much replicated (confirmed) what Hänig found before: that all parts of the tongue can tastes all tastes, but with different sensitivity (like, if you have a bit of salt, or a bit of sweetness, one part may detect it earlier than the other). The difference is not that large (imagine already quite diluted broth or juice, and then diluting it 2-3 times more).

But by now people are so used to calling "tongue map" a hoax, that it's almost appropriate to cite Collings' paper "in the opposite direction", so to say: to stress that the map _does_ actually exist :) Because the tongue isn't really "all the same": there are differences. Just they are rather tiny :)
