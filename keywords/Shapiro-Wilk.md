# Shapiro-Wilk test

#stats

Test for normality. Calculates a certain W statistics from covariance matrix, then either uses tables  (of $(W,n)$ I assume?), or some other trick to transform W values to normally distributed values. (On its own, W-values for H0 of normal distribution are close to 1, but slightly lower, forming a hump with a lont left tail).

It's not clear whether W can be considered an "effect size" of sorts, but on a surface, it seems reasonably close to an effect-size-like-variable.
