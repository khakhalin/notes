# CRUD (and REST)

#api #systems

See also: [[database]], [[sql]], [[restful]]


**CRUD** stands for CREATE - READ - UPDATE - DELETE. It is more of a general (and really old: 1983) framework for creating an interface between two entities. Apparently it stems from ealy DB systems, but the main reincarnation of CRUD is REST (of [[restful]] fame), which is a web-style API.

SQL was also originally based on / inspired by CRUD.
