# Giant axon

#neuro #comparative

Atlantic squid (foot-long) has a giant axon that is 1 mm in diameter.

However, Giant squid (Architeuthis) doesn't have a giant axon at all.

> Arguably, if you are really huge, there's no hope to accelerate fast, and so insta-propagation becomes less critical. It would be nice to have, but it won't save you, so the selection is not that strong.

Humbolt squid however does have "spaghetti-like" giant axons. Apparently.
