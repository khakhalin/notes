# Endian-ness

Aka endianness. How numbers (aka "words") are stored in memory. Two options:
* big-endian (BE): the most significant digit goes first (smaller memory address)
* little-endian (LE): the opposite way (from smallest bit to largest)

Normally doesn't matter above hardware, as everything is harmonized supposedly; but matters for data-dumps.
