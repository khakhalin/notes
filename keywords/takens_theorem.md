About whether a deterministic high-D **dynamical system** can be reconstructed from observations of only one of its coordinates ($y$). Yes, it's possible! If the system is d-dimensional, we need to keep track of about $k = 2d+1$ delayed observations of $y$ (that, is vector of $[y(t), y(t-τ), y(t-2τ), ...]$ to learn to predict y.
