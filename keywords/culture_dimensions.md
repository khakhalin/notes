#culturdiff


Proposed around 1973 by Geert Hofstede, who worked for IBM, and studied values of people of different cultures. The first reasonably successful quantification of cultural differences. Asked people lots of questions in surveys, came up with the following dimensions

1. Power distance (PDI) - Arabic countries (high) vs Denmark (low)
2. Individualism vs collectivism (IDV) - US (high) vs Malaysia (low)
3. Uncertainty avoidance (UAI) - Belgium (high) vs Sweden (low) - not clear why
4. Masculinity vs femininity (MAS) - "heroism and assertiveness" (Japan) vs "cooperation and quality of life" (Norway)
5. Long-term vs Short-term orientation (LTO) - Japan (high) vs US (low)
6. Indulgence vs restraint (IND) - Latin America (high) vs Eastern Europe (low)

### Masculinity

> From the description is almost feels like "Masculinity" may actually represent a gap in gender norms, or "Presence of toxic musculinity" maybe, as in "hero-worshipping societies" "feminine" motivations are a taboo for men, but in more "feminine" societies they are ok. Which begs the question of whether it's more about polarization and split of priorities than about an average position. Unless you also take into account the fact that in hero-societies men are probably way more vocal. Also, wouldn't he almost exclusively sample men at IBM in the 1970s?

In his data, M is high in Japan, Eastern Europe, and Germany, but very low in Nordic countries. Which is curious both in terms of Germany vs Scandinavia, and because in [[world_values]] and [[conflict_styles]] plots Scandinavia is typically clustered with Japan, but here we have a clear difference.

### Critiques

Wiki has a good overview. Nation-state is a weird way to agglomerate that, there's gender gap surely, and overall averages are not always the best way to compare things.
