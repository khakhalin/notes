Roeder KD. (1975) Neural factors and evitability in insect behavior. J Exp Zool.
Sometimes it's better to be unpredictable when you are avoiding a predator, as then the predator can not guess where you would go. Noctuid moths have special super-noisy neurons that unpredictably change their flying patterns when the moth is hit by an ultrasound beam.
