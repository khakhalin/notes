**Cron** is a utility (service) to execute certain commands regularly. **Crontab** is a utility to edit files that describe which jobs are to be run regularly. For cron to work, you need to create a special `crontab` file (traditionally, no extension, and named `crontab`, which apparently stands for "cron table"). 

# Crontab file format

The crontab file starts with setting some paths and other environmental variables, such as  `PATH` snf `CODEDIR` (the last one, probably pointing at the folder where all the useful programs are stored). Then go crontab job lines proper.  Every job line has the following format:

```bash
30 4 * * 1 root python3 $CODEDIR/demo/script.py
```
The meanings of the first 7 positions are:
1. Minutes. If minutes are not empty (not `*`) while hour is empty, it will run the job every that many minutes. If minutes are not empty and hour is also non-empty, it will run the job at that time (hours:minutes). If minutes are empty, but something else is not, the value of minutes will be assumed to be :00.
2. Hours
3. Day of the month (1 to 31)
4. Month
5. Day of the week. Both 0 and 7 mean Sunday, and one can do one day, or something like `1-5` for working days, or `1,3,5` for a list.
6. Username (in practice, probably `root`)
7. Then goes the actual command to be scheduled.

# Crontab utility

To actually make these commands execute, they should be placed somewhere in a file or a folder that cron reads. There's no need to "recompile" the jobs in any way when the file is edited, as cron checks for edits automatically. Many manuals insist that to create a crontab file one needs to run `crontab -e`, but this command just starts an interactive editor (like vim) to type crontab commands in. It may be helpful when working remotely, but if you are copying files on a remote computer, and your jobs are non-trivial, you may as well prepare a crontab file in advance. In which case, to schedule it, do `crontab crontab` (the first one is the command, the second one is a file name, if it is the filename you use). Another benefit of preparing and uploading a file in advance is that in this case running `crontab -r` by mistake doesn't ruin all your progress (coz in the `-e` workflow you don't have a reserve copy).

Other commands:
* `crontab -l` - see what jobs are currently scheduled (what crontab file crontab is keeping in mind). Note that it won't be that helpful if cron is set up directly, without crontab.
* `crontab -r` - remove all crontab jobs
* `crontab -u root` - specify a user (can be mashed with other keys. I think `root` is the default value on [[docker]])

# Cron service

Setting it up: ðŸ”¥ ????????

Checking if it works, stopping, and restarting
```bash
service cron status
service cron stop
service cron start
```
