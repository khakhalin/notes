An blog post abut the FIRST competition, and how coding robotic actions in Java is full of ugly anti-patterns. Argues that the best solution is **coroutines**: (afaik, i got it correctly) routines that are asynchronous in nature, but emulate sequential execution, and thus can be used in robotic scripts. (like, again afaik, the trick is that every routine takes care of executing for some time, and then checking if it needs to be executed further? not sure)
