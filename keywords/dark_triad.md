Three "dark" personality traits:
* Narcissism - egotism, pride, and lack of empathy
* Machiavellianism - tendency to manipulate and exploit others
* Psychopathy - impulsivity, antisocial behaviors, lack of remorse

> These seem to be super-not-orthogonal, no? Especially the way Wiki describes them, where all three basically mention "lack of empathy". How can the same trait be present in all three coordinates?

Among the big5 traits ([[ocean-model]]), correlates with lack of Agreebleness, lower Conscientiousness, and higher Neuroticism.

Seems to be a relatively recent framework (late 1990s?). Attempts to link antisocial behaviors (in mental health and legal contexts) to some personality traits. In terms of its origins, it seems to be not a narrowing down of a larger model, but rather something of the opposite: an attempt to go beyond saying the psychopathy and narcissism are essentially the same thing, but showing that there's more than one component to it.

Often talked about in the context of toxicity, internet-trolls, workplace culture etc.
