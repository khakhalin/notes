Developed by a neuroscientist David Marr, as a general research programme for understanding brainz. Some people really like them.

1. **Computational** - describe the problem and the target
2. **Algorithmic** - how to solve the problem
3. **Implementational** - describe the physical mechanism that will solve the problem
