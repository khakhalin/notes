# Inverse Conway's Maneuver

2015, a thought experiment by James Lewis. If you want the product to have a certain structure, change your organization to "seed" this structure into your processes. The assumption is that if two teams are not collaborating closely, they create an interface (a negotiated agreement) both IRL and in the product.

That said, even in his very first original paper Conway advocated for the organizational structure to be flexible, as "the first design of a product is rarely the best one", so it's not really a year 2015 breakthrough.

As a practical example, the book "Team topologies" by Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais argues that [[microservice]]s are essentially a co-evolution of product in response to Conway's law as it helps to compartmentalize responsibility (so they are primarity an organizational, and not a technological idea). But it also means that if you decide to use microservices from the tech pov, for whatever reason, you'd better re-structure your teams accordingly.
