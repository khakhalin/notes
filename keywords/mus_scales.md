**Draft outline in Russian:**
1. Есть западная гармония, простая математика
2. Базис её - в мозговедении
3. Но выбор обертонов для гаммы - непрост, и неуниверсален (just intonation etc.)
4. Более того, мы его не придерживаемся, променяли на свободу модуляции (equal temperment)
5. Другие культуры держатся за натуральный звукоряд
6. Но более того, есть эстетики "романтических", нестабильных интервалов (макамы, русская народная терция)
7. Есть культуры для которых возможность параллельной диатонической модуляции оказалась ещё более важна, и они используют целотоновую гамму (грузия)
8. Более того, нейро- делает гармоничным звуки на основе их состава; не все звуки имеют натуральный спектр (гамелан, William Sethares)
9. И если кажется что это экзотика, напомнить что в западной музыке октавы шире чем 2:1, потому что рояльные струны нелинейны (Railsback curve)
10. Более того, есть традиции в которых ценится даже не нестабильность, а напряжение (istrian scale, bosniak ganga, Krk)
11. Наконец, бывает музыка и вовсе без гармонии / мелодии, но тем не менее музыка вполне, с богатыми традициями (e.g. Ewe drumming)

It was a prediction based on certain assumptions about our sound perceptions, lots of "common sense", and knowledge of sound processing. The question now, is it purely theoretical? Of all musical cultures on earth, were there any that use (or used) weird scales and weird timbers that match each other, and therefore sound harmonious, even though the base frequencies don't form simple ratios?
It turns out that they very  much exist, and we'll consider two examples now. (Gamelan, Saradzhev)

## Octaves stretch

After Gamelan; like: you think they are weird, but you are not? Stay tuned. Actually our music is also crooked. Western octaves are not obvious, at least in the piano. They aren't exactly 2:1
Explain why. Non-linearity of strings that makes upper harmonics higher than they should be theoretically. Especially for bass strings. 6:3 is most commonly used (6th partial of one string, matching it with 3d partial of another string). An alternative (2:4) is slightly narrower; is used in Russia. The reason for an octave choice: minimization and equalization of beating between overtones (similar rationale as for equal temperament, only in the realm of overtones).

Alternative explanation: maybe without beating (stretching) two notes blend too perfectly and become "flat" and indiscernible. So in fact if you ask many people to tune two tones in an "ideal octave", or ask people to judge how "good" the octaves are, US people (at least) prefer the octaves to be a bit wide. It is not clear whether it is cultural (learned), or kind of biological (natural for the brain).

## Oriental scales

These scales are not necessary "harmonious" in the same sense as gamelan scales we discussed earlier. From the melodic point of view it may be beneficial to have some notes sound very "unstable" (and there are several ways, in theory and in practice, to achieve this goal). An intentionally unstable note may either call for an immediate resolution (example)…
* Classic Arabic maqam – name and example?
Or be used for so to say "existential uncertainty"
* Turkish example with a note that is moved around – also find the name

"Studying scales" is sometimes used as a kind of damning statement in modern musicology, when modern musicologists explain why "old school" musicology was so bad and useless. Or at least that's my impression. "All they did was describing scales!" they say. Unlike modern musicology that is all so complex and grounded in the real world, as opposed to some imaginary "musical scales".

In my opinion however there are at least two valid reasons to "study scales".

One: it may teach us something about brain, about the "theory of music", and about the theory of our cognitive processing of sound and music. Depending on where your philosophical alliances are, you can hope that it would teach you something about the "universals" of music, and about how the fleeting realities of our life are actually linked to some weirdly eternal physics and math… Or in the very least it can tell you something about evolution, brain development, the "nature-nurture" debate, and human psychology.

Another reason is that the scales used in music make one of the rather fancy qualities of local music, and therefore when cultures interact (split, conflict, or get influenced), musical scales (that can be measured mathematically with ease) can make an interesting subject for a study. For example, many western instruments use a fixed scale, and it is a "western" scale, whatever it is. When western music (be it classical or pop music) starts to influence local music; becomes popular, or maybe fashionable, several different things may happen. Old traditional scales may be abandoned, with people switching to the "western" scale, or "western" music may be adjusted and incorporated in the local tradition of tuning. 

> Some musical examples: Turkish, Kurdish pop, Blues maybe…

As cultures interact, people of the "minority culture" may become "ashamed" of their native tunes, in the same way as people get ashamed (for the lack of better world) of their language or dialect (Polish in the US; Finnish group languages in Russia; Irish in Ireland in 20-21 century), or they can become "proud" of their tuning (similar to how in the world of linguistics it happened with Hebrew, Ukrainian, or Irish in Ireland in 19th century). 
Here we'll consider one interesting example.

Bruno Nettl wrote about "functional music" - aka participatory, as opposed to "art music" that may be arbitrarily conceptual. Many people apparently consider this term outdated today. See for example: Nettl, B. (2010). Nettl's Elephant. University of Illinois Press.
