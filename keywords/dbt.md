# DBT = Data Build Tool

Parents: [[devops]]

#devops #stub


A tool to transform data. Mostly looks sql-like (with extra stuff), but now also supports python blocks that get a [[pandas]]-like dataframe (but is not actually pandas, but just something vaguely similar, yet [[snowflake]]-native, called a snowpack (ðŸ”¥?) dataframe), and returns a dataframe. It's also possible to use pandas, but it's way slower.

dbt jobs can be run by Apache Airflow
