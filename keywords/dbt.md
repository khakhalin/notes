#devops #etl


A tool to transform data, roughly equivalent to oldschool ETL jobs, but better (at least for simpler transformations that don't include fancy modeling / ML). Loks mostly SQL-like, with extra features and operations, but also supports python blocks with [[pandas]]-like dataframes (but not actually pandas: at least when working on [[snowflake]], it's some snowflake-native thing, called a snowpack dataframe ðŸ”¥?). It's also possible to use actual pandas, but it would be way slower.

dbt jobs can be run by Apache [[airflow]]
