# Keyboard

Mac keyboard is strictly worse than a normal keyboard in three aspects:
* Modifier key placement
* Behavior of Home and End keys
* Absence of a normal EurKey layout

The modifier keys can be swapped in the settings.

Use CapsLock for changing languages - it's better than the alternatives (assuming that you only use 2 languages of course)

To make Home and End keys behave normally, do this:
