# Hotteling test
#stats

**Hotteling test**, aka **Hotelling's t-squared distribution** is a generalization of t-test to multivariate hypothesis testing. In essence, if you have 2 clouds of points in dim>1, and you want to check if the clouds are located differently, instead of doing a coordinate-by-coordinate comparison (lots of separate t-tests), it may be better to run this one.

Looks especially meaningful in 2D case, perhaps just because 2D visualizations are more common than many-D visualizations (irony haha).

Wiki claims that there are better alternatives, with some references.
