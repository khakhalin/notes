A type of process on graphs in neuroscience. Neurons that are connected together by their activity (possibly through [[stdp]]-type interactions), so now their connections encode this activity. If you activate it, you get a replay. If there's a resonance between a temporal input and the encoded activity - you have a strong response, and thus they act as a discriminator.
