# Scrum

#tools #lifehack #management

Highly formalized, open, collaborative product development framework framework for small or medium-sized teams. Iterative, incremental, team-centered.

Roles:
* **Product owner**: The voice of the customer. Owns the "Product backlog". Lots of negotiation and communication here.
* **Developers** - subj
* **Scrum master** - kinda a facilitator; apparently not a project manager, but someone to help to follow scrum methodology and resolve external conflicts? Educate on the methodology, and promote self-organization.

Key elements and terms:
* **Product backlog** - Like a target to-do list of product requirements. Includes features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements ([[dictionary]]) etc. Often described as use cases and "user stories". Visible to everyone, but only modified by product owner. Ranked by by value to the customer and effort to implement (?), classified on a Fibonacci scale (? _read wiki, but still don't get it_)
* **Burndown chart** - estimated amount of remaining work, in hors. Usually goes down, but can go up a bit sometimes.

Workflow:
* **Sprint** - basic unit of develpment; 1-2 weeks. Starts with **sprint planning**, and setting a goal. Finishes with a **sprint review** and **sprint retrospective** (I think one is on the actual results for the project, and another one is for the scrum methodology, but I'm not quite sure.)
* **Daily scrum** - central meeting, alwas starts on time, limited to 15 min, open to visitors. Each member shares their contribution from yesterday, their plan for today, and if there are any impediments (risks, stumbling blocks etc.) No detailed discussions - these are delegated to separate follow-up meetings.
