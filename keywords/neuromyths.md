Examplse:
* [[gustation]] - on tongue regions
* [[myers-briggs]] - beloved pseudoscience of self-classification

Other:
* Marshmallow test
* Ego depletion
* Using 10% of the brain
* Red dress
* Hot coffee priming
* learning styles
* left/right brain personality (_see below a summary for learning, but I think I've seen a paper on L/R brain personalities in general, based on self-reporting and assessments of friends and family, that also showed no effect, but now I cannot find it_) #todo
