Other:
* Marshmallow test
* 10%
* Red dress
* Hot coffee priming
* learning styles
* left/right brain personality (_see below for learning, but I think I've seen a paper on L/R brain personalities, based on self-reporting and assessments of friends and family, that also showed no effect, but now I cannot find it_)
