# Partial Correlation

If lots of variables are all cross-correlated, and if you want to measure the effect (or rather, coördination) of variable x with variable y, that is unique for this pare of variables, with everything that shared with other variables {z} removed. In practice, you find a component of x that is ⟂ to Z (a linear space on {z}), and a component of y that is ⟂ to Z, then correlate them:

$\text{corr}\left(x-⟨x, Z⟩ \; , \; y-⟨y, Z⟩\right)$
