# Flake8

To exclude a row from tests (to make it an exception), write `# noqa: E800` after it. It will remove it from this particular rule. Use a comma-separated list for several rules. In particular, `E800` is about forbidding commented code (which from linter's pov somehow includes any formal writing).

Flake does not have "on" and "off" commands to disable linting for a segment of code, unfortunately. Either row by row, or an entire file :( To do an entire file, add `# flake8: noqa` to it.

Linters also obviously come with a config file where one can put some rules on a permanent ignore list. For example, by default Flake8 doesn't allow lambda-expressions. Who would ever want to work with a rule like that? No one!

# Isort

Isort literally just sorts imports at the beginning of the file.

To exclude a file from isort, add `# isort: skip_file` at the beginning

# Black
