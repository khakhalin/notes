**Typical Sample** is an idea related to the Curse of Dimensionality: in higher dimensions the idea of "average point" becomes less useful. A mean of lots of colored noises is a gray square, which looks nothing like any of the data points.

"In very-high-dim a Gaussian is almost indistinguishable from a uniform distributinon on a sphere." (Huszar 2017)

Therefore, the only reasonable way to deal with very-high-d spaces is to find points that belong to the distribution, but have a high response, and show these points.

Corollaries: 
* Interpolation between points in high-d cannot be linear, as high-way you'll have an average of 2 points that doesn't lie in the distribution. Instead, use polar coordinates. _Would Manhattan interpolation be a case of polar coordinates, or is it different?_
* When interpreting detectors, be prepared that if you are optimizing in a space that is very different frm the space of stimuli, the "optimized stimulus" will look weird. (Like a visual illusion of sorts? See [[Olah2017visualization]])
