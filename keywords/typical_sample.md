**Typical Sample** is an idea related to the Curse of Dimensionality: in higher dimensions the idea of "average point" becomes less useful. A mean of lots of colored noises is a gray square, which looks nothing like any of the data points.

"In very-high-dim a Gaussian is almost indistinguishable from a uniform distributinon on a sphere." (Huszar 2017)
