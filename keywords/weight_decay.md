# Weight Decay

Related: [[06_DL]], [[adam]], [[02_Regression]] (everything abour regularizations)

A type of **regularization**, in which weights a made to decay to 0 during training. For **Stochastic Gradient Descent** (SGD), it's exactly equivalent to L2 regularization, but for other descent methods (such as ADAM), it's not necessarily the same thing.
