#culturdiff


Different cultures have different attitudes towards conflict, and these attitudes can be classified on a plane, with 2 axes:
1. Confrontational vs Confrontation avoiding
2. Emotionally Expressive vs Unexpressive

It leads to roughly 4 quadrants (labels are mine, not universally accepted):
1. CE - Israel, Russia, France, Spain
2. CU - Germany, Netherlands
3. AE - Philippines, Arabic countries, India
4. AU - Japan, Korea Nordic

UK is kinda center, but leaning Japan. US is kinda center but leaning Israel. 

> It is still unclear to me if this is based on an empirical data, or whether it is an attempt to present personal wisdom in a mathy way, or whether it somehow draws on [[culture_dimensions]], but tries to frame them in this new way. Also I am still not sure what would be an authoritative peer-reviewed source on this topic, and if it even exists. Some more detective work may be needed here.

> And then there are cultural differences within US regions as well. I think I remember the chart, where US was split into Midwest (more Scandinavian), NY (more Eastern European), and South (more Arabic-like). But now I cannot find it.
