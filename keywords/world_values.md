The famous source of pretty charts. Another name: the **Inglehartâ€“Welzel cultural map of the world**. Developed around 1980s, inspired by [[culture_dimensions]] by Hofstede.

They use only two very general axes:
* Survival vs self-expression
* Traditional vs Secular

Originally highly Eurocentric, but later expanded to the world.

> My memory of them having "power distance" as one of the coordinates is clearly wrong. Probably I looked at some pdfs that were based on WVS, and compared it with Hofstede methodology. Also, WVS site itself doesn't seem to contain any pdfs, so one would have to look for them separately. (Unless they aren't googlable)

One can also look at trajectories of how countries change in time (_google for "world values survey" trajectory, get links to fun articles_).
