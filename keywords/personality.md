## VALS
A trademarked system methodology for psychographic market segmentation, introduced in 1980 by Arnold Mitchell. 8 groups, and roughly 2D. One axis - primary motivation, that can be Thinker, Achiever, and Experiencer. Another is almost like individualistic vs communal, and parallels those with Believer, Striver, and Maker. And then two float separately - Innovators and Survivors, as like ultra-realizations of this 2nd axis.
