Vals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VALS
A trademarked system methodology for psychographic market segmentation, introduced in 1980 by Arnold Mitchell. 8 groups, and roughly 2D. One axis - primary motivation, that can be Thinker, Achiever, and Experiencer. Another is almost like individualistic vs communal, and parallels those with Believer, Striver, and Maker. And then two float separately - Innovators and Survivors, as like ultra-realizations of this 2nd axis. While it seems to still be popular with marketers and business people, apparently, it doesn't work that well, compared to other personality-based segmentation. But also it seems that scholarly psychologists don't even study it seriously, or at least I couldn't find non-business articles about VALS easily. It being so heavily trademarked and advertised may be one of the reasons. So at least for now, I assume it to be a dead-end.

Soto, C. J. (2019). How replicable are links between personality traits and consequential life outcomes? The life outcomes of personality replication project. Psychological Science, 30(5), 711-727.
About 90% of studies that connect big5 character traits to some life outcome replicate; even higher for studies with decent sample sizes. Although effect sizes at repliation are typically smaller (about 70% on average). So the replication crisis is not that bad in this field, actually. (That's after attempting to replicate 78 prior studies on this topic).
