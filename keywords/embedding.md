# Embedding layers

Embedding layers solve the problem of data sparsity for [[06_DL]], so you don't have to train directly on long one-hot encoded vectors. Empirical rule of thumb: dimensionaltiy N dim ~ (n possible words)^(1/4). (ðŸ”¥ no idea where this formula is coming from) With too few dimensions you won't capture the complexity; with too many - you overfit, and training takes longer. N dimensions can be treated as a hyperparameter, and optimized.

One possible approach for an unsupervised pre-training: get hold of some similarity or co-occurance measure; use it to produce groups, then "withhold some information", predicting missing members of a group based on those that are visible.
