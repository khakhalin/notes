Get a bunch of people and run a thought experiment: tell them about something (a service, a product), and ask them 4 questions:
1. At which point you would say "that's way **too expensive**, I'll never buy it for this price"
2. At which point it's so cheap that it can't be real, and you'll never buy it either (**too cheeap**)
3. At which point the price would feel like a "good deal" for you, a **bargain**, worth a try
4. At which point the price would start to get **expensive** and you would think twice before buying, even if you needed it?

Once these points are collected, build cumulative distribution functions and see where they intersect. Say, when the same share of people find the product to be "a bargain" and "expensive", that's probably the mid-point (**indiffence price point**, or IPP). The intersection of "too cheap" and "too expensive" is sometimes described as **optimal price point**, or OPP, as the least number of people refuse to buy at this price. One can also get the price-range by crossing "too cheap" with "expensive" and "bargain" with "too expensive".

An obvious drawback is that it's totally theoretical, and people may not introspect their behaviors. Also people may lie (including to themselves) because of implicit social pressure, moral valuing etc.
