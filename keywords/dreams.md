Woke people with dysfunctional hippocampi at night, asked them about their dreams. Got fewer dreams overall (~4 times fewer), less content, no cohesion (used some "content score"). Less complex, less "episodic-memory-like", fewer details (measured through informative words), less bizarre, but about same vivid and emotional. Conclusion: #hippocampus is important for dream integration across brain modules? It looks to me however that they cannot really differentiate between the quality of the dream, and the quality of reporting on the dream (they try a little bit, by comparing the frequency of "blank dreams", but I think it's really unconvincing).
