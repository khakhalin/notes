They are looking for signals, and mostly it’s  “no” signals (red flags) rather than  “yes” signals. For example, blaming others and being negative about things is a bad sign. Don’t try to fake it, as being fake (not genuine, shifty, fishy) is the worst possible sign there could be.

Ultimately: is this person a net positive contributor?

In tech companies, typically not the HR, but a high-level manager.

**Schema:**
* **STAR: Situation → Task → Action → Result**. A general paradigm for answering behavioral questions. Describe the Context / Challenge, then what was done, then what was the result of it. Probably followed with long-term lessons learned.
* or **CAR: Challenge → Action → Result**
* or Goal > Solution > Impact > Lessons

**Typical questions:**
* A conflict (disagreement, sticky situation) you had
    * either any conflict, or narrowed down: with a colleague, boss, direct report, client
* Stressful situation / work under pressure, and how you handled it
* A mistake you made, a goal you did not meet
* A goal you met, a success, going above and beyond 

**General advice**
* Know your own CV, including the language, as they are likely to refer to your experience using the language you used.
* Practice / write down key stories in advance. Set up the situation fast. Elevator speech. No tangents. Only essential details. Action and result centered, anchored in decisions and actions.
* For each project, identify 1-2 key achievements, and very high-level overview of the technical side of it, but be ready to dive down if needed.
* This is a communication skill: ability to be clear, on point, deal with emotions etc.
* Know why you made each of your career transitions. Why you quit, why you joined.
* General mindset should be that past failures made you better.
* Mentioning intercultural fluency and awareness is a plus.
* Leave space for follow-up questions; maybe even invite them to some degree.

About scoring CAR (Challenge-Action-Result) schema. In a good response all three aspects should be good.
