Barabasi's response (2018) to Anna D. Broido and Aaron Clauset and paper that claimed that scale-free networks are not real (_I haven't read it yet, so not sure if it's a good summary_). His response is basically that they invented their own definition that is not good, as it classifies Barabasi's original model as not scale-free, while a substantial share of Erdos-Renyi graphs are scale-free.

Original challenge:
AD Broido, A Clauset. Scale-free networks are rare. arXiv:1801.03400
