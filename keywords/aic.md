The most common approach to implement **Best-subset regression**: when we want to manually find a combination (subset) of k variables that offers best fit for this k. There's an efficient algorithm for that, called **Leaps and Bounds procedure**. 

Main ways to decide which one to use: empirical **cross-validation**, and AIC = **Akaike Information Criterion**.
