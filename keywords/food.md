# Roasted veggies

* Cut potatoes, carrots, parsnip, other roots in about equal sizes. Carrots, cut obliquely, for fun
* Garlic, entire cloves, with the skin, smash a bit, distribute evenly. Don't mince (minced burns)
* Oil, salt, pepper, dried herbs. Distribute. Woody fresh herbs (rosemary, sage, thyme) are also good
* 30 min 200C
* Add similarly cut (half- or quarter-) salted+oiled red onions
* 60 more min 200C
* Some 15 min before done, add mushrooms, peppers
* Eggplants and zucchinis are probably too watery to work well here
* Sprinkle fresh herbs on top if desired
