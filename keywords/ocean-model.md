Developed in the 1980s, as psychology emerged from the "personality research winter" of 1960-70 (it was fashionable to claim back then that personalities don't really exist). OCEAN is an abbreviation for a the list below. Derived qualities (like "warmth" can then be projected into these coordinates - usually presented via correlation coefficients).

Five factors:
* Openness to experience (inventive curious vs consistent cautious)
* Conscientiousness (organized vs careless)
* Extraversion (outgoing vs reserved)
* Agreebleness (compassionate vs critical/rational)
* Neuroticism (sensitive vs confident)

About 50% of variance shared in twin studies.
