Developed in the 1980s, as psychology emerged from the "personality research winter" of 1960-70 (it was fashionable to claim back then that personalities don't really exist). OCEAN is an abbreviation for a the list below. Derived qualities (like "warmth") can then be projected into these coordinates. The total number of surveys run now is in the 10^6 scale. Not a commercial thing (good!).

Works by taking lots of adjectives, asking people agree or disagree with them, and then doing factor analysis ([[pca]]) to extract useful signal from these statements.

Five factors:
* Openness to experiences and idea (seeking new experiences vs preferring the familiar)
* Conscientiousness (organized and prepared vs careless and extravagant)
* Extraversion (outgoing and enthusiastic in engagement vs reserved and solitary)
* Agreebleness (compassionate and conflict-minimizing vs critical and calculating)
* Neuroticism (sensitive and fragile vs confident)

Each factor is scored, and across the population we have a normal distribution of each factor.

About 50% of variance shared in twin studies. Retest preserved variance (retest correlation squared): about 0.8 in 30 days; ~0.5 in 6 years; ~0.2 over 30 years. And changes are somewhat predictable by age: A and C tend to go up, N tends to go down; O is low in kids, then stays high until about 50, and declines.

Big5 factors may have interesting and not-obvious interactions with [[culture_factors]] ("word values"-style), as depending on how culture frames virtues and vices, it can make personality traits correlate in different ways. For example, in some cultures being critical may also be seen as pro-social, while in other cultures it would be anti-social and impolite, which of course would strongly affect person's position on the A axis. There are also average difference in big 5 values between cultures: like, low-confrontation emotionally-expressive countries like Philippines (see [[culture_values]]) tend to be low on neuroticism. Which would have been impossible if Big5 were purely biology-driven. So culture clearly shapes the landscape!
