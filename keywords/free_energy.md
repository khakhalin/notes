# Free energy

#freeenergy #bib

A theory by Karl Friston, about Markov Blankets, and information flow that is notoriously divisive, in the sense that people either don't understand it at all and pretend that it doesn't exist, or claim that it is the answer to everything, and the only useful framework to think about life, cognition, and the meaning of it all.

The Dialectics of Free Energy Minimization Evert A. Boonstra and Heleen A. Slagter
Seems to be a review explaining the free energy minimization principle for an organism. It's not math though; looks almost like philosophy?
