Graph traversal, aka path search, aka travel routing algorithm. Very similar to Dijkstra's, but improved by using a heuristics. As with Dijkstra, we have a weighted graph, and we are building a tree, trying to reach from a source node to the target node.

It also tries to extend the "best node", but instead of only relying on the distance from the root g(n), we'll use a sum g(n) + h(n), where is a heuristic "guess" about how helpful this node could be, in terms of reaching the target (expected distance from n to the target). To find the node with minimum g+h we use a priority queue, as always.

The choice of heuristic h(n) is problem-specific: for example, on a map, it can be a straight-line distance to the target. A good h(n) (monotone or consistent) is one with a property of h(i)-h(j) â‰¤ d_ij, where d_ij is the length of edge from i to j. With this additional requirement, A* always finds a solution, and no node has to be processed twice (we never have to go back). That's because with this requirement you can never "cheat" by getting "negative distances" after you already invested in some part of a graph; your "current best route monotonously increases".

But that said, apparently, sometimes you want to use suboptimal h(i), trading optimality for speed (?). Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Bounded_relaxation
