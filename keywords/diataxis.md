A way to write technical documentation for software projects.

Four genres that form a sort of a "political compass" 2D space:
1. **Tutorial** (learning, action) - first and foremost, a learning exercise. Visible results, narrative of the expected, point out what they should notice, target the feeling of doing, encourage repetition. Not a good place for explaining abstract stuff! Also don't get distracted by options and alternative ways of doing things (unless that's a deliberate point).
2. **How-to guide** (application, action) - unlike a tutorial, the end-goal is not a pretext for learning, but the actual goal. Provide a good set of instructions, including possible forks and checks.
3. Technical **reference** (application, understanding) - only describe; don't explain, instruct, or opine. Provide examples.
4. **Explanation** (learning, understanding) - principles, background, history, opinions, perspectives, alternatives. Discussion.
