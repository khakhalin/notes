A chaotic system, originally inspired by biological homeostatic systems with negative feedback. Shows that if feedback is slow (as defined by a delay parameter τ), behavior can become chaotic.


$\displaystyle \frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \frac{βQ(t-τ)}{1+Q(t-τ)^n}-γQ(t)$ 

A standard set of parameters: β=0.2, γ=0.1, n=10, and τ~20,  to have it chaotic. For smaller τ, one gets multiplying cycles, as usual, but at τ~15-17 it transitions to chaos.
