BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a probabilistic ranking algorithm that scores document relevancy, compared to a search query, based on keyword matching. Seems to be used as a more "hard" threshold after a "softer" embedding-based search in [[vectordb]] for [[rag]]s.  The formula is basically [[tfidf]], but with discounting of document length (so that longer docs wouldn't always win), and an explicit discounting of keywords that are mentioned too often (aka saturation).

The formula is large and is given here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25

One of the reason people like it, is that it works, and is standard, and one doesn't have to reinvent the wheel. Not because it's platonically perfect, but because it's good enough.
