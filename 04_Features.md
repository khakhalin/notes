# Feature engineering

#features #bib


Large subtopics:
* [[dim_reduction]] - dimensionality reduction
* [[variable_selection]] - selecting and constructing features
* [[clustering]] - methods in data clustering 

Other notes:
* [[embedding]] - embedding layers, doing dim reduction in DL
* [[linear_separation]] - picking a good coordinate system for classification
* [[basis_expansion]] - projecting to a meaningful basis can help
* [[rbf]] - radial basis functions
* [[smoothing]] - a type of feature transformation
* [[fairness]] - on the practical choice and interpretation of features
