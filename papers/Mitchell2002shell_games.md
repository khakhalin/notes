An interesting idea that in a fragmented landscape, where the predator is looking for prey, the prey faces a particular challenge during exploration / exploitation. Staying in one patch is often safer, but not necessarily the safest option, as if the predator is certain in which patch to find you, they'll find you. So the optimal strategy is to mix changing patches (even though the prey is more vulnerable during the change), and exploiting the patch.
