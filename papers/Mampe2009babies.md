Analyzed cry of 30 French and 30 German babies from 2 hospitals (Berlin and Paris). Found that German and French newborns have different cry profiles, that apparently reflect typical prosodic patterns of each language. Even though they could only listen to this language from the womb (but also it was pretty much the main thing they were listening to). 

German babies rise (both frequency and volume) early on, then slowly relax. French babies rise (again in both frequency and volume) much more slowly, and then drop quickly. Nice figures. They call it "Cry melody".
