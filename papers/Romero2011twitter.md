Data from 2009-2011, 3B tweets, 60M users. Calculated the average "exposure curve" for top 500 hashtags (looking at hashtag virality). The curve grows really fast, then peaks and kinda platoes, with very slow decay.

Introduced a simple, almost visual measure of **curve persistence** = the area under the curve, divided by time âˆ™ peak (like a rectangle drawn around the curve). High persistence = low decay. Show that curves for different thematic hashtags have different average shapes: idioms and music decay fast (low persistence), while politics and sports linger. Music has a higher peak, compared to, say, tech and movies.

So it's mostly a paper about how different topics have different cascade dynamics, not about the math of it.
