Main effort: implantable bidirectional interfaces in freely behaving individuals. Current commercial platforms include: Neuropixels (ephys), Inscopix (fiberoptics), Neurolux (micro-LEDs), but also lots of research, including neuron-line electrodes, magnetic, biotic electrodes, and whatnot.

Biggest problem: mechanical; a 10-100 difference in rigidity (stress moduli). We want something thin and bendy, but still with good electrical properties. Other approaches (microfluidics; light-triggered release of pharmacologicals) are also tested (_but that's only for research, right? It's not like one can saturate a human brain with some light-activated pharma chronically, no?_)

Another option: purely optical interfaces. As optic fibers are used, most of this tech is tethered (the animal is always connected to a bigger box).

Microcomponent polymeric probes. Targeted drug delivery. Programmed pharmacology (precise temporal control, sell-specific etc.)
