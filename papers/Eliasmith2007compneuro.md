#neuro

More of a philosophical introduction.

Two very different disciplines:
* Applying math methods to neuroscience data
* Theoretical neuroscience

"A premium on biological realism" - not just how something can be done, but how it is done by the brain.

> Arguably, there's less of an emphasis on it right now? Or maybe I'm just more interested in studies that put less emphasis on it. Or maybe researchers have actually realized that unless they lower the bar for biological realism, they won't be able to do much theoretical neuroscience.

Two fields that almost don't talk to each other: cellular and cognitive.

Focus on **implementational issues**: how many neurons, what signal/noise ratio, time constant, connectivity patterns etc. 

> He claims that cognitive people don't care about it, but an interesting development is that in 2021 (14 years later) this is no longer true. Neural networks, both as a model, and as a way of latent reconstruction, allowed us to ask implementational questions about higher, more abstract tasks, as well.

Lists main problems:

**Representation**, or how concepts and perceptions are encoded in the brain. Temporal and population aspects are intertwined, but often studied separately, which is weird. Rate code and timing code schools of thought. Claims that it was shown that rate code cannot transmit information at speeds observed in the brain (Rieke et al. 1997).

Population: a vector representation: each neuron is a basic function, and we combine them. (_But he clearly understands it in a slightly different way than I would think of it, as he finds some limitations here that I don't see_)

Two pages on **semantics** (it's presumed representation in the brain) that I don't get (too philosophy).

Computation, dynamics, cognition (a few pages for each). _In my view, a bit too oldschool to be immediately relateable, but maybe I just don't get it._
