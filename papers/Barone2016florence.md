This article claims that top earning families in 15th century Florence are still somewhat top-earning in 2011. The effect is small, but significant and "non-negligible" (5-10% of current wealth/income). Sadly, no illustrations, just tables.

Quotations:

> We exploit a unique dataset containing detailed information at the individual level for all people living in the Italian city of Florence in 1427. These individuals have been associated, using their surnames, with their pseudo-descendants living in Florence in 2011. … We also find an even stronger role for real wealth inheritance and evidence of persistence in belonging to certain elite professions

If I got it right, they looked at last names that are specific for Florence (as opposed to being generic Italian). Many last names obviously disappeared, but for those that are still in the population, it is possible to run some comparisons.

> ...A one standard deviation increase in the pseudo ancestors’ log earnings increases the pseudo-descendants’ log earnings by 6% of its standard deviation. The effect, besides being positive and significant, is also non-negligible from an economic point of view. Put differently, being the descendants of a family at the 90th percentile of earnings distribution in 1427, instead of a family at the 10th percentile of the same distribution, would entail a 5% increase in earnings among the current taxpayers.
