# Tracking and analyzing animal behav
A collection of references to papers that track animals, and then analyze their behavior. (Not sure they deserve individual cards at this points, so going for a summary)

Shemesh, Y., Sztainberg, Y., Forkosh, O., Shlapobersky, T., Chen, A., & Schneidman, E. (2013). High-order social interactions in groups of mice. Elife, 2, e00759.

Simplistic analysis, and not that popular based on citations, but fun idea. They tracked 4 mice over time, hot-coded where within the arena each of them was at each time (vectors like x=(1 3 2 5), where each number is a nest, or a feeder, or something like that). Then analyzed these 4d vectors. Showed that if you guess full 4d P(x) from pairwise probabilities, you overestimate rare combinations by a lot. Which supposedly means that mice don't just interact pairwise, but behave as a group, and so "cluster" more tightly in the state-space. Nice, and probably very simple, way of analyzing this kind of stuff.
