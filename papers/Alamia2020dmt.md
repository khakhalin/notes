Psychedelic drug DMT, serotonin receptor agonist (sic!). Used ceremonially by Amerindians (Ayahuasca).

Less α-band with closed eyes; increased entropy of EEG correlates with hallucinations (some refs in the intro). Increase in θ-waves. In normal visual perception, there are **traveling waves** that propagate from the occipital cortex towards frontal cortex (a wave of oscillation envelope, an increase in amplitude, traveling across the brain in ~100-200 ms it seems). And sometimes similar waves go backwards.

After DMT, with eyes closed, O→F (forward) waves increase in amplitude, while backward waves decrease in amplitude.

They interpret it as a decrease in "precision weighing of priors"", which is not really a term (doesn't seem to be used in other literature). But they call it that way. Essentially it's how in normal vision we always correct our perception (bottom-up) with our expectations (top-down), but in hallucinations it doesn't happen, and the bottom-up process runs free, converging on strange ideas. **Predictive coding hypothesis** (lots of refs in the "Discussion" session, last paragraph).

They also found correlations (in time) between how this imbalance of traveling waves went, and self-reported perceptions.
