#freeenergy


Not a good summary. It pretends to be written informally, but is actually very hard to understand (partially because of that).

Brain as a machine that collects of information: not just uses it to infer stuff, but seeks it, and even chooses which info to seek. But to have information, you need objects, or states, that are separate from each other. **Markov blanket**: according to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_blanket), some sort of a collection of variables that describe the node, which in a markov net includes the node itself, everything that immediately leads to it (parents), and all immediate children.

For the brain, he claims, it's all the sensory info (sensory state) + active states, or the output of behavior, sorta.

And then he claims that a stable system doesn't dissipate (with some metaphors about ink in water and what not). Which means apparently that for this active system with a Markov blanket, if it were to exist for a prolonged period of time, it needs to maximize Bayesian model evidence (what??). Or, which is the same, minimize free energy (what ??).

Somehow brings up, as an example, that functional areas in the brain stem from the fact that this world has properties, which means that it may be beneficial, from the practical point of view, considering them separately. Like "what" and "where". That's a direct consequence of the fact that objects move, but remain the same as they move, so concepts of position and identity may be disentangled. 

From there, somehow arrives at gradient descent. Extremely unclear!
