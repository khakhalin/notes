Unsupervised learning in the cortex (awake behaving mice).

Brief summary of the tweetstorm: unexpected visual stimuli drive a distinct response in the visual cortex. And from a basic modeling pov, if sensory systems do something like predictive coding, unexpected events should lead to a change of internal models, and thus some sort of unique plasticity in the cortex. We also know from connectivity studies that in the sensory cortex, distal apical dendrites are involved in top-down processing, while proximal dendrites and somata are concerned with bottom-up processing (??? what ???). Showed a bunch of "shade-like" frames, but every now and then shades were oriented differently. Find that distal dendrites are selectively activated by unexpected events. This effect increases with experience: in a course of just 3 days, and without any deliberate supervised learning, responses to "expected" (within the context of a sequence, mind it) and "unexpected" (out of context) stimuli become more compartmentalized (proximal for expected, distal for unexpected). In both L2/3 and L5 neurons.
