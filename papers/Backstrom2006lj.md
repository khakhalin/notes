A more flexible approach to modeling than a standard SIR-like model: try to combine decision-based and probabilistic models, and derive a dependency between the probability of adoption, and the number of friends that adopted an innovation. p(k) is probably monotonously increasing, but the shape may be weird (S-shape, for a bistable, decision-like situation), or maybe even non-monotonous (if you are getting annoyed when all your friends convert, so you don't convert just out of a principle lol). The paper doesn't have all these pretty pictures though; it's mostly a descriptive analysis of what was happening with LJ.
