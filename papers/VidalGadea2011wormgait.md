Dopamine is needed to switch swimming→crawling
Serotonin for crawling→swimming, and to inhibit crawling-related behaviors

As of then it wasn't clear whether swimming and crawling were produced by the same circuit (and thus be two varieties of the same gait), or by two different [[cpg]]s.

They made a video of worms and measured curvature, as those transitions in and out of water. Crawling: 0.5 Hz. After submersion, 6s delay, then swimming onset, with bending at 1.7 Hz. Foraging and pumping happens during crawling, but not during swimming. In viscous environment - alternative between these 2 gais.

Fig1: Introducing "curvograms" (X=time, Y=worm's length, color=curvature at this point).

Fig2: How worms mix swimming and crawling in viscous environments (shown as a histogram of curl-cycle periods), and how if you feed some iron to worms, and then turn on the magnet, making movement harder, they also switch from swimming to crawling. Same if you try to (gently?) squish them between 2 pieces of glass.

Fig3: If you remove certain mechanosensitive dopaminergic neurons (via genetic ablation), worms crawl good, then start swimming in water good, but upon emerging, just stop moving (cannot initiate crawling). - Same if you impair dopamine synthesis, or mutate out mechanoreceptors.

Fig4: If you apply external dopamine to worms, they start "crawling" while in water. If you knock-out D1 receptors and apply dopamine, they don't. If you do optogenetics on those neurons mentioned above, it works as intended. Same if you do photo-uncaging of dopamine.

Fig5: If you compromise serotoninergic system in worms, they can't start swimming in water (a "mirrored" deficit, in a way). Ways to achieve it:  ablate certain Ser neurons, or mess up with serotonin metabolism (weaker effect, but consistent).

Fig6: If you apply serotonin, or stimulate these neurons using optogenetics, it kinda promotes swimming. In this case the effect is weaker than with crawling; it doesn't promote "fake swimming" in the absence of water, but it made swimming onset happen fast, and make crawling onset (upon water evaporation) happen later. _So a weaker version here; Fig6 doesn't mirror Fig4 as good as one would wish, but they kinda present it as a mirrored experiment_
