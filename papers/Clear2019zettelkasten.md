A good description of how zettelkasten works. The main idea is linking cards. So, to paraphrase, the rules seem to be:

* Always add new stuff in this system. Don't take other notes. Feed the Zettelkasten!
* Don't be afraid to create new notes. Don't try to systematize. Add new notes (nodes), and let the graph live.
* Always link new nodes to existing nodes. Don't leave them alone, integrate them into the system, by linking to stuff.
* Never just cite; always either comment liberally, or rephrase. Shape it into your external memory.

Some asides and consequences:
* As an aside: tags are good, but limiting. Still it's probably a good idea to at least tag any new card.
* Aside to aside: at this point I don't know how to tag this one ;)
* In Zettlr (as in paper card version) direct (outcoming links) are clearly visible, while incoming links are hidden. Still, unlike for paper notes, in Zettlr you can fetchc the name of this card, and put it in the search box. You'll get all cards linking this card.
* My current system of naming cards after papers (author-year-topic) is actually still not complete Zettelkasten, as it retains (and follows) the desire to keep control of card readability. The original system by Luhmann allowed him to let go of this fear of control, and just inject information into the system, relying on the power of links.

Extra references and notes:
* Archive of Luhmann's cards: https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_1_1_V

It seems that he also mostly filed cards within a tree. So every card was "guaranteed" to belong to a certain thematical box (sometimes strongly, sometimes loosely). Any other links would come on top of that. Perhaps With Zettlr, it's easier to use tags as this "guarantee of minimal inclusion", just because they are so much easier to implement.

* Why Luhmann had to start a 2nd system ZK2 (abandoning the ZK1): https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmanns-second-zettelkasten/
* Some analysis of how Luhmann branched ideas, with a conclusion that his process was NOT specifically about branching ideas, even if in many cases it happened like that: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/

It seems that while his system was ingenious, Luhmann was also constrained by the physicality of cards that could only get that much info on them. So if he kept having thoughts, he would have to create a linked list of cards. We however can just add stuff to the same file.

This note, for example, would have been represented by several linearly linked notes in his system. But in Zettlr, it's easier to just keep writing, until you need to branch (and actually, maybe, even for some time after that, until the branch becomes too long).
