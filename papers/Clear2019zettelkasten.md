A good description of how zettelkasten works. The main idea is linking cards. So, to paraphrase, **the rules** seem to be:
1. Always add new stuff to the system. Don't take other notes, in other notebooks and places. Feed the Zettelkasten!
2. Don't be afraid to create new notes. Don't try to impose a pre-conceived rigid structure. Add new notes (nodes), and let the graph live.
3. Always link new nodes to existing nodes. Don't leave them alone, integrate them into the system, by linking to stuff.
4. Never just cite; always either comment liberally, or rephrase. Treat it as a conversatoin, ot shape it into an external memory.

Some **asides and consequences**:
* As an aside: tags are good, but limiting. Still it's probably a good idea to at least tag any new card.
* Aside to aside: at this point I don't know how to tag this one ;)
* In Zettlr (as in paper card version) direct (outcoming links) are clearly visible, while incoming links are hidden. Still, unlike for paper notes, in Zettlr you can fetchc the name of this card, and put it in the search box. You'll get all cards linking this card.
* My current system of naming cards after papers (author-year-topic) is actually still not complete Zettelkasten, as it retains (and follows) the desire to keep control of card readability. The original system by Luhmann allowed him to let go of this fear of control, and just inject information into the system, relying on the power of links.

### Extra references and notes:

* **Archive of Luhmann's cards:** https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_1_1_V

It seems that he also mostly filed cards within a tree. So every card was "guaranteed" to belong to a certain thematical box (sometimes strongly, sometimes loosely). Any other links would come on top of that. Perhaps With Zettlr, it's easier to use tags as this "guarantee of minimal inclusion", just because they are so much easier to implement.

* **Why Luhmann had to start a 2nd system ZK2** (abandoning the ZK1): https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmanns-second-zettelkasten/
* Some **analysis of how Luhmann branched ideas**, with a conclusion that his process was NOT specifically about branching ideas, even if in many cases it happened like that: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/

It seems that while his system was ingenious, Luhmann was also constrained by the physicality of cards that could only get that much info on them. So if he kept having thoughts, he would have to create a linked list of cards. We however can just add stuff to the same file.

This note, for example, would have been represented by several linearly linked notes in his system. But in Zettlr, it's easier to just keep writing, until you need to branch (and actually, maybe, even for some time after that, until the branch becomes too long).

* From another [blog polst by Phil Houtz](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-its-like-gtd-for-writing-and-here-s-why-you-should-consider-it-7dddf02be394): Actually, as it turns out, **Luhmann had tags** as well. For keywrords and key themes, he used special cards that listed cards related to this keyword.

> Which implies that maybe my current system has everything he had. The general outline and structure of the repo is analogous to his filing system; longer files that grow out of a seed of an individual card are analogous to his chains of linked cards, and tags are like keywords. Only better. And I can look for things. And I can search incoming links. And I can improve my cards much more easily! Yay!

### Some writing by Luhmann himself: 
**Communicating with Slip Boxes**:
http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes

For this system to work, it should feel like a communication. For it to feel like a communiation, it should be different (have a different schema) than whatever you have in your mind as you use the Zettelkasten, or try to use it to write. There has to be an element of surprise. 

Advices against "filing in order", as in a book catalog, precisely because it would bind you to a certain system of thinking for decades. Instead, just file them one after another, with incremental address-liek numbers. _Which implies that either I have misunderstood the structure of the archive above, or that the archive was restructured when it was put online, to make reading easier, or that Luhmann actually was more systematic than he wanted to be, and than he recommended._

He also had bibliographic notes (that only contan info about the books), and then cards dedicated to these books, once he read them. At which point, obviously, the former link to the latter. But at the same time, different thoughts and ideas from the same book should be split across different cards, so that, ideally, they would aquire a life of their own. Because some will be involved into clusters of cards, while some will be forgotten, or maybe even lost, and it is OK.

> This may imply that linear sequences of thoughts, like this file, should be mercilessly broken down once there arises a slightest temptation to break them down (to reference a part of it). Because if you want to reference a part of the file, then you shoudl really have two files (with the first linking to the 2nd).

A funny quotation: "If you wish to educate a partner in communication, it will be good to provide him with independence from the beginning. A slip box, which has been made according to the suggestions just given can exhibit great independence."

> Still unclear, from this short article, how he wrote after all. Did he start with an outline, and then followed it, going on tangents through the links?

### Some more information on how Luhmann wrote
https://mindyourwriting.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/how-famous-researchers-work-niklas-luhmann/

It seems that, when it was time for him to write the book, he would just start creating an outline, linking it to cards. He spent most of his time on that: linking cards, and maybe improving cards themselves, and not working with any kind of "final text". And then he would just produce a text; and he woudn't revise it.

Which is where we should stop following his stead, it seems, as his writing is apparently is well known to be confusing, extremely dry, convoluted, and hard to read. Poorly structured, repetitive, long, and aesthetically unpleasing (it's a quotation from someone).

> But that's OK, as once we have a draft text, we have other ways of working with it, don't we? If we solve the problem of making an interesting first draft appear, that would already be a huge win!
