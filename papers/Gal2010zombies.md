This is a **comment on a research paper** by same authors: Gal, R., & Libersat, F. (2010). A wasp manipulates neuronal activity in the sub-esophageal ganglion to decrease the drive for walking in its cockroach prey. PLoS One, 5(4), e10019.


Parasitoid jewel wasp *Ampulex compressa* stings roaches in the head, injecting venom into its cerebral ganglia. That turns roaches into "**zombies**". And this poses an interesting conesequence for interpreting spontaneous behavior in insects as "free will". If when they are messed up by a wasp, it feels that roaches were turned into "zombies", and stripped of something, doesn't it mean that they had this "something" originally? **If hijacked roaches don't have free will** (or at least it feels like it to us), then it kinda follows that **normal roaches do** have free will.

Start with nice poetic references to Jewish theological literature. But do small animals have free will, or are they just automatons with "mistakes"? Example of a fly in a featureless white space that still flies randomly.

What happens to roaches: after being stung, they don't get paralyzed, but also don't initiate spontaneous behaviors, and don't escape from aversive stimuly (the wasp eats its antennae and drinks hemolymph). Then the wasp **grabs the antenna and pulls the roach**, and it "**follows submissively**", with a normal walking pattern. Then it leaves the roach in the nest, puts an egg on its leg (note: not inside the body as with many parasitoids), seals the nest, the roach eventually gets eaten from inside.

From the  neuroscience pov, the venom seems to selectively elevate the threshold for initiation and continuation of walking, while walking itself, and thresholds for other behaviors, are apparently spared. _But then why doesn't it fly away?_

Some particular ganglion (sub-esophageal ganglion, or SEG). Same effect as in zombie roachces if anasthetic is injected there. Inject in another ganglion; can have a super-running roach.
