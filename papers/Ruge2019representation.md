Made humans follow arbitrary rules (images→ finger moves, or tones→ finger moves, of different complexity) while in fMRI. Measured voxel activation, applied multivariate pattern analysis technique (MVPA) for representation dynamics (cite their own paper from 2018, and some older, going back to 2001). Claim that it can do some fancy "time-resolved identity-specific pattern correlations within runs".

Basically this MVPA works like that: measure voxels, consider them a vector, calculate corr() between responses to the same stimulus, and between responses to different ones. The measure (Identity-specific multi-voxel pattern similarity) = corr(same) - corr(different). 

Show that PFC is max involved during first time presentation, then declines. For more complex tasks, PFC is involved for longer.
