Introduce **criticality**. As precise boundary is hard, there's a band that it is OK. 

How to tell? avalanches, sensitivity to perturbations (divergence of succeptibility; this paper may be a best link to illustrate this point). 

Insist on inherent **modularity** of biological networks. For their model, iteratively, hierarchically link subnetworks bottom-up. Use topological dimension D (power law); their model produces **fractal networks** that span a large range of D. Intermediate quasi-chaotic behavior arises in hierarchical systems as some modules may remain chaotic when others are ordered. Small world networks are dysfunctional precisely because they don't have this behavior. Everything is global, so death-chaos border in them is very sharp!! 

In their model neurons inactivate with p1 and propagate to connected nodes with p2, which they slide to find a tippint point between death and stable activation. In hierarchical modular networks it's not a point, but a band. 

Claim same effects in C elegans connectome. Then somehow link it to spectral analysis of these networks (not sure how exactly).
