They created a fake data where if you plot BMI against the number of steps somebody took, it looks like a really over-the top cartoonish Gorilla drawing :) But some points were supposedly "male", and some "female".

Then they asked students either "Hey, did gender matter?", or "Hey, what's in the data?"

Those with a hypothesis were 5 times less likely to make the plot and spot the gorilla :)

Students are not experienced scientists or professional data practitioners of course, but still fun.
