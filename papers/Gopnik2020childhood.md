Humans have a very long childhood; even chimps are self-sustaining by age 7, while humans need at least 15 years. And childhood is expensive: in a 4-year old at rest, 60% of energy is used by the brain (~20% in an adult). We even started to live longer to support these babies (Grandmothers as alloparents).

Main thesis: training needs in humans are so demanding that childhood "involves a distinctive set of cognitive characteristics that actually trade off with adult characteristics". Motivation to learn: exploration with almost no exploitation. Apparently, a rough correlation across species, in terms of maturation length vs. eventual brain complexity. **Simualted annealing** (loweing temperature during training) as a ML metaphor for childhood.

Some interesting links (by Frankenhuis W) on adaptability, and a meta-trade-off between less flexible precocial animals, and more flexible animals with long learning periods.

"Young children are noisy, variable, unfocused, unpredictable and impulsive." :)

**Play** as childhood par excellence (a pure "explore" strategy, as it by definition doesn't pursue any reasonable goal, and so doesn't exploit anything).

Older animals don't just learn less, they also shift to exploitation strategies, and become less **neophilic** (preference for novelty, rejection of stasis). An impressive reference supporting the shift among species.

Children apparently are better than adults in solving certain types of logical problems when the solution requires some "out-of-the-box" probabilitistic thinking:
