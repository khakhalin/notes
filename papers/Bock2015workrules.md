### 2 Culture eats strategy for breakfast

Three cornerstones:
* Give freedom to people, trust them (google maps as an example)
* The power of having a purpose (calling, mission)
* Transparency (open info with the junior; clear regular top-down communications; open Q&A sessions; record-keeping practices for key decisions). _This one is pretty similar to P&G management practices I remember_

Some internal competition (say, Chrome vs Android) is OK, but mostly think of it as "late binding" - waiting until it's clear which direction is promising (not a conscious rate race, GM-style).

At least back then (2015) still felt like a democracy. Put innovation in the hands of the people. "Bureaucracy busters" program in 2009, to identify and reduce unnecessary redtape.

### 3 Hiring is the most important activity in any organization

Advocates against training on the job, as (apparently) you cannot train an average performer to be great. Instead, just hire the best. Companies that invest in training have their money "spent in the wrong places" (sic).

* Only hire people who are better than you
* The best people don't always look like what you'd expect

### 4 Searching for the best

Few very hard puzzles don't work (select wrong people: too narrow, unable to teamwork etc.) GPA doesn't work too (no correlation with job performance). Ridiculous "escape rooms" don't work too. Yet the process has to be rigorous if you want to hire good people (as it's really hard to get rid of weak and toxic people).

> Why is it so? Why is it hard to get rid of underperformance? I can see how it can be problematic with toxic people, if everybody around them are nice, but weak performers seem to be rather straightforward if you have a well running mechanism of yearly peer-reviewing, no?

The experience of rejected candidates also matters (for an ambitious or a fast-growing company), as it may gradually affect the public perception of this company (at least among professionals).

### 5 Don't trust your gut

First 10 seconds decide the interview. And that's bad.

Brain teasers don't work: too discrete of a skill, easily trainable, but no correlation with work performance.

A summary of correlation coefficients squared (var explained) between interview-stage measures and work performance (from Schmidt Hunter 1998)
* Reference checks: 7%
* Unstructured interview: 14%
* General cognitive ability (basically an IQ test of sorts): 26% - but this this one is of course also discriminatory (biased).
* Structured interviews: 26%
* Work sample: 29%

At least back then they liked people who speak about "we" and not "I", when describing successes.

> Is it a metaphor? Or do / did they really expect a "we"-language at behavioral interviews? (Which is fair, but wouldn't it be kinda at odds with how people are usually forced to behave during job searches?)

**Googlyeness**:
1. Enjoying fun; taking courageous and interesting paths in life
2. **Intellectual humility** (absence of arrogance; ability to accept mistake; create a productive, transparent work atmosphere)
3. **Conscientiousness**, sense of ownership (Quote: "we want owners, not employees")
4. **Comfort with ambiguity**
