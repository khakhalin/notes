### 2 Culture eats strategy for breakfast

Three cornerstones:
* Give freedom to people, trust them (google maps as an example)
* The power of having a purpose (calling, mission)
* Transparency (open info with the junior; clear regular top-down communications; open Q&A sessions; record-keeping practices for key decisions). _This one is pretty similar to P&G management practices I remember_

Some internal competition (say, Chrome vs Android) is OK, but mostly think of it as "late binding" - waiting until it's clear which direction is promising (not a conscious rate race, GM-style).

At least back then (2015) still felt like a democracy. Put innovation in the hands of the people. "Bureaucracy busters" program in 2009, to identify and reduce unnecessary redtape.

### 3 Hiring is the most important activity in any organization

Advocates against training on the job, as (apparently) you cannot train an average performer to be great. Instead, just hire the best. Companies that invest in training have their money "spent in the wrong places" (sic).

* Only hire people who are better than you
* The best people don't always look like what you'd expect

### 4 Searching for the best

Few very hard puzzles don't work (select wrong people: too narrow, unable to teamwork etc.) GPA doesn't work too (no correlation with job performance).
