Susceptible-excited-refractory (SER) model. Create different connectivities, look how it translates into functional connectivity. Seem to mostly think about MRI connectivity, not neurons. Reference that given a network, assumptions about units ("nodes") doesn't affect functional activation that much. Say, modules and hubs act as such either way. Justify their choice of a cellular-automaton-like approach (SER), link to forest fires and pandemics; with good refs. Here: look at undirected only, and at synchronous (not sequential) activation. Because their networks don't auto-regulate (?) strong dependency on initial conditions: if they blast-activate everything, they get negative correlations between functional and real connectivity. (If less strong activation -positive). Triangles as pace-makers, so important to average over many runs (but that's coz undirected). Scary formulas with unique notation that I skipped. Figures withour axes.
