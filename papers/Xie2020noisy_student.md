Google. Something weird semi-supervised learning with noisy teachers and distillation. Essentially, it seems that a badly labeled large dataset is better than a well-labeled small dataset, so it's better to train one model on a small dataset, then have it label a huge dataset (even tho many labels will be wrong), and then use this large dataset to train the next model. Or something like that. Weird.
