They are trying to tech the network to assess the game state, so it's not about drafting (inspired by AlphaGo: [[Weidman2018alphago]]). Claim that HeartStone is a "testbed for AI research". Their simulator runs 10K games per second.

> Abandoned for now, as it's really about tree search, with a practical algorithm. Revisit if needed.
