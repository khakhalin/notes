Low-level personality traits, such as desire to achieve things, or desire to understand, correlate with GPA, but with quite low coefficients (r~0.2). Which means that less than 5% of variance in GPA performance (r²) can be explained by character. That's on n=652.

Interestingly, playfulness had a negative correlation (−0.2). Which raises questions (about either the nature of play, or the way our education system is designeed)

Aggregating individual traits to Big5 level lowers correlations somewhat: for example, r goes from 0.2 for desire to achieve things, to 0.16 for Conscientiousness, to which it supposedly contributes (??). Which suggests that character proper affects GPA even less than individual quirks on its own.

No proper prediction analysis, only correlations.

It's a replication of an earlier study, and reports a good agreement of numbers from the original report.
