White Storks kill their babies (lots of videos on the internet), and black storks do as well. Most animals don't - this behavior is pretty rare, but it's very common in storks. Depending on the year, from 0% of nests to ~30%, with the average of about 10%, it seems (although high variability).

Main reasons appear to be:

* Eggs are layed with a delay, but incubation starts right away, which means that the difference between the 1st and the 2nd, or even the 3d chick, is quite significant.
* Variable food, year to year + high parental investments
* The way storks feed the babies prevents sibling competition (big chunks of food brought to the middle of the next, slow feeding process), and chicks aren't equipped to kill each other, which apparently is a super-common thing in most birds. Chicks either physically harm each other, or weaker siblings progressively starve to death

So the hypothesis, essentially, is that storks are one of the relatively few birds in which more common ways of brood regulation don't work. So it falls on the parents. And if food becomes scarse, they get rid of the weakest chick, by throwing them out of the nest. Even when they are already relatively old. But sometimes when they are young (sometimes even at the egg stage). Some sort of optimization strategy.

Also, some interaction with testosterone and behavior. Stronger mothers produce chicks with more uniform distribution of testosterone between chick 1 and chicks 2-3, and fewer die. In weaker mothers, there's a steep drop-off, and a greater difference in chick behaviors.

Most other species (not storks) practice parental infanticide only when it is sexually driven: that is, when their partner died, the chicks are still small, and it's better for them to mate again, maybe even reuse the nest. Storks are more of an exception.
