**Schooling** in a fish (Notemigonus crysoleucas, aka Golden shiner). Looked at who turned first, and how it propagates through the network, using a graph of fish-fish interactions, reconstructed from videos. Social **behavioral contagion**, mostly local interactions, cascades of behavior change, self-organized groups.

Really pretty figure (Fig 3A) of a graph of all fish-fish interactions.
