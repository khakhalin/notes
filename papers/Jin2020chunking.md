Claim that this experiment should help to figure out whether humans perceive language as a probabilistic markov process, or fitting words to grammar-defined "chunks". The general idea for the latter approach: feed a human words that have similar grammatical structure (Lame eagles eat snakes. Brown tables dance walz. etc.) Then whatever activity is shared across all sentences would reflect the grammar of this sentence. But there are alternative explanations as well: 

* It may be grammar (chunking).
* Or it may be lexical property, such as "verb activity", "noun activity" etc. No chunking.
* Or it may be semantics-based, like a Markov process (just because a beginning of a new sentence would be a beginning of a new thought, and thus a semantic jump). Also no chunking here.

Formed a "fake grammar" by making participants track certain properties of words in a stream of words. Here, only nouns, some live some not alive, and participants were asked to either identify pairs (streaks length two) of one kind (AA, NN), or alternative sequences (AN, NA). If you actually estimate the spectra (fixed lexical properties, vs. semantic similarity, vs. chunking with length=2), one can expect different slow-frequency spectra (at the rates comparable with word delivery rate, and they used precisely 2 words a second). Also, if you make the same person do "same", then "different", and compare the phases, you can distinguish these 3 rules from each other even better.

Brain activity (MEG) followed chunks, and not individual words. Bilateral temporal (strong) and frontal (weak) lobes.

Main concern of course is that these chunks are artificial (not really fake grammar, as they are trying to pretend), and of fixed length, which may be an entirely different mechanism, compared to natural language processing.
