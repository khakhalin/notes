Used evolution algorithms to find networks that perform well with **random weights**, using precocious animals (those that can do useful things right after being born) as a metaphor.

> Compare to [[Xie2019randomwire]] who used a simpler search + some weight-learning. If you invest in search, you can divest from training.

Tasks used: bipedal walker, car racing (lil 2D game).
