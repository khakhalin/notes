Early access to computers (before age 6) differs a lot by country, from ~50% for Nordic countries and Israel, through ~30% for most of Europe, and down to ~10-20% for Middle East and Japan. Girls always lag by about 10%, with some fun exceptions (Japan, China, New Zealand - except that Japan is actually exceptionally low, while NZ is pretty high)

Students who report feeling lonely use Internet more (well, duh).

Most computer-oriented school systems: Nordic, NL, Czechia. Least: China, Japan, Korea.

**Fig 6.3**: Claim that in terms of math performance, the more computers are used in school, the lower is the _change_ in math PISA scores from 2003 to 2012. So from this POV, NZ, AU, Finland, Czechia - all kinda tanked, and all use computers a lot, while Turkey, Mexico, and Brasil improved a lot. Doesn't seem like an interesting causal statement at all to me. Like, if computers mean "rich for a while now", and rich mean decent PISA scores in the past, you'd expect something like that, no?

**Fig 6.7** At the same time, they also have some analysis that is averaged across countries, but split by student performance (is 1 data point before average = 1 school here? Not sure, but probably not "1 student"). Find that **students who don't use computers in math classes score better in math**. Not by a lot though: about 2% of the total score.

[This article](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/08/rotten-stem-how-technology-corrupts-education/) (soft paywall) shows a bar chart that they claim came from PISA, but that I cannot find on the PISA site, with a title "Give students a laptop to knock off half a letter grade". Show consistent detrimental effect of computer technology on PISA scores, with largest effects on reading, smaller on science, and yet smaller on math. Some effects are tiny (wifi ~ 2% worse, desktop computer ~3% worse), some are huge (tablet ~10%, e-book readers ~15% worse). The only tech that helps are projectors (10-15% boost). The article claims that it's from "540,000 students in 72 countries". 

I cannot find the data though; the article doesn't reference it, and the exact wording from the figure cannot be found on the PISA site. Also, the x-axis says "Change in PISA scores", which I now strongly suspect may actually be "a change between one year and anothe year" (as reported above), which woudl mean that the plot is questionable, and the % reported are actually not the attribuable effects, but literally, changes that happened in schools from different "privilege strata", so to say.

So if my guess about the origin of this data is right, it wold be wrong to claim that giving ebooks to students is predicted to drop their scores by 10%. What's fair to say, is that rich schools that happened invest in ebooks (arguably, a particularly useless piece of tech, not used by most schoos) also tend to worsen their math scores in the long-term (over course of 10 years), - probably (or at least that would be my buess) because they don't invest in more meaningful stuff (teachers, innovative pedagogy etc.). At least my hypothesis would be that it speaks more about school management strategies, than about classroom effects of tech.
