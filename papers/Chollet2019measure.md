Endorsed by many great  people. Essentially, on how transfer and generalized intelligence may look, and how they may be tested. That's why I'm placing it in "Self-supervised learning" section: it is not really about it, but it is something that goes beyond approximating a data set; something like "transfer par excellence!""

There is now also a Keggle challenge developed after it:

Nice set of examples: repeat the pattern, move one part relative to another, color according to a certain rule, fill the gaps, etc. Like a set of nice IQ tests on a grid. A human (me) has no problem with some, and can figure others after 30-60s of concentration. But it's quite obvious that modern types of AI would have enormous problems with it.
