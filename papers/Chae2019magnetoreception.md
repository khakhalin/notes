Either a breakthrough, or a great example of p-hacking. They claim that only hungry men that look at blue light can guess the direction of the magnetic field, with about 60% probability (not quite, they have some index, but still H0 is 50%). N=20. Claim that hunger is important because "hunting", and maleness is important either because "hunting", or because glucose levels in the blood drop faster.

Didn't do repeated measures with feeding the subject.

Looks iffy, no?
