The most famous review on this topic.

Great introduction. First talk about network science in general, and how it applies to brains, including the limitations of straight connectomics, and the necessity of statistical and hierarchical approaches. Then cover cliques, cavities, and persistent topology. Introduce activity on networks, and of networks (dynamic networks), prophesizing that the combination of both is the future. 

Multilayer networks: combine several networks (across time or subject) into one, using "node-identity" edges. A whole section on "network control" - that is, using network info to nudge the activity of the system.
