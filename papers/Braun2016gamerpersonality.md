Assessed big5 ([[ocean-model]]) in about 3k people online. Separately, assessed index of gaming addiction in these people. Game addiction is associated with high neuroticism (and here they replicate about 7 prior studies).

Lots of confusing and explicitly confusing results in prior studies (refs for both "yay" and "nay")
* on the amount of neuroticism in casual games, 
* on whether violent games (they call them "action games") interact with neuroticism.

Allegedly, role-playing gamers were shown to be lower on extraversion.

Gamers seem to be more open. 

Maybe, less agreeable (but this is likely to different by genre and stratum, so personally I wouldn't believe too strongly in this.) Definitely lower agreeableness in addicts, and in those playing violent games.

Conscientiousness is complicated: higher in casual gamers, but lower again in addicts. Differences not even by genre, but by playstyle. Seems to be lower for those who play for achievement (ref), no link with violence (ref).

In this paper, when looking at overall amount of gaming, they get positive r with N, and negative with OCEA, but OA are very weak and disappear if control for gender. Higher r of −0.25 for C. But also, for OCEA curves (of how a trait changes from non-gamers, to casual gamers, to involved gamers) are monotonous, while for N it drops, and then increases again.

Summary table:
Nongamer	Sim	RPG	FPS	Strategy
Agreeableness	5.5	5.7	5.7	5.7	5.6
Openness	5.4	5.2	5.3	5.1	4.9
Conscientiousness	5.2	5.1	4.9	4.9	4.7
Extraversion	4.9	4.4	4.4	4.8	4.4
Neuroticism	4.2	4	3.8	3.6	3.6

This is overall very suprising. Strategy players are lowest on C? Just how?? Strategy and SIM are also on the opposite ends of the spectrum? (In terms of OCN.) But that's probably because the classification of games is stupid; most sim games are like farming simulator or flight simulation; games like SimCity or Banished are relatively minor in the sim category, it seems. SIM/RPG/Strategy being lower on E is really the only trend I can understand here.
