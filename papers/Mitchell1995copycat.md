# The Copycat project

#transfer #gi

Real interesting old project on generalizations; PhD work of Melanie Mitchell, described, among other places, in her "Complexithy: A guided tour" book.

She worked with short sequences of letters. The only thing the system is allowed to know apriory, I think, is that the letters form a sequence. And then it should figure out - and transfer - rules based on one example only. For example:

* abc → abd. ijk → ?
* abc → cab. ijk → ?

Etc. And then she expected the system have some "opinion" about what to do with sequences like "iijjkk". And these solutions to be guided by some level of parsimony.

> How the program worked? This is something I haven't got yet; need to give it another read.

Feels like a really interesting predecessor to [[Chollet2019measure]] conceptual series of tests.
