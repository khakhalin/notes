Non a research paper; more of a news piece with some interviews. Deascribes neuroscientist **John-Dylan Haynes**, who studied people in a fMRI scanner. Show them random letter, ask them to press either of 2 buttons (spontaneously), and remember the letter that happened to be shown on the screen at this moment. 

They found that they can predict (with only 60% accuracy) the decision (which finger would be used) 7 seconds before the act is actually made. Apparently, before the participants are consciously aware of the decision (_how do they know?_).

> Check the original article for details. It's kinda hard to argue about this experiment without these details.

From this they have a complete personal existential breakdown, as somehow they feel that if you make a decision before you feel that you made a decision, then you didn't make a decision. Which is something I personally cannot relate at all.

History of similar experiments: **Benjamin Libet** (1980s), based on EEG, but with similar results (prediction).

Another related piece of research **Itzhak Fried**, electrodes implanted in humans before epilepsy surgery; activity of individual neurons predict decision to press a button about 1s before the action. His take on it is actually much more sane: that the decision is admitted into conscionsness (awareness) at some point later in the game. Probably some time before the action, but not even necessarily. Makes a good built-in counterpoint if this piece is assigned as a reading.

Then the author of the article shifts  philosophers, including those funded by the John Templeton Foundation. The panel: Walter Glannon, Adina Roskies, Al Mele. Two main definitions of free will philosophically (according to Glannon):
1. Ability to make a rational decision
2. Ability, given a history of the entire Universe, reach different devisions

My take: so, after all, free will is a 2D notion that always has some superposition of computation and spontaneity. Depending on whom you ask, the contribution of these two notions, to make a "perfect free will" is different, from panpsychists, who accept "no computation, full spontaneity" as a case of free will (like in this case a candle or a radioactive atom has free will), to some sort of human exceptionalist, maybe sualists (in which case most animals don't have free will, but somehow humans have, at least when they are enlightned or something. I'm not sure they are actually saying that, but I'm imagining they might be saying that :)

And also on top of that a bunch of philosophers make contradictory claims, saying that various concepts involved in this entire discussion either don't exist, or are  irrelevant. Some invoke deterministic universe, taking it as a synonym for "materialist", which is of course non-sensical (because chaos).

**Michael Gazzaniga** brings up parallelism (good), and that there's no point in thinking about the brain as a linear stream of events. It makes the time when the decision enters the awareness much less relevant. I wonder if he's right, and that's one of the most important insights some people don't get. It would be both optimistic and sad if it's true, as it is so simple!

Thought experiment about stretching both the scope of the decision (committing a crime instead of pressing a button), and time span (say, days instead of seconds). If we could predict at these scopes, would free will still exist? (a quote from Al Mele) The problem of course is that while as a thought experiment, it seems to be just a quantitative change in numbers without a qualitative change in the problem itself, in practice it is quite qualitative, because of the Lyapunov time for the brain (I hope I used this term correctly here!). The typical time at which the brain is chaotic, which is definitely not days.

 **Kathleen Vohs** published this famous paper about how reading about determinism (absense of free will) makes it more likely that people would cheat on a test. _Was it replicated?_
