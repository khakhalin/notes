A Masters thesis actually.

"Bateman and Boon coined the concept Demographic Game Design (GDG)"

Reviews Freud and [[myers-briggs]] rather uncritically, which is a worrying signâ€¦

A _huge_ review of game genre classification systems, most of them either too weird and general, or way too fragmented and unstructured. Also one neuro-inspired pseudoscience (Chris Bateman and Richard Boon, who are apparently big names in game design, and especially game narrative design, but this serotonin/amygdala classification makes no sense).

Then presents lots of results in a hard-to-digest form, but there's a lovely table at the end, which compares [[ocean-model]] to game genres:
* People high on N prefer action (including shooters), fighting, and sports
* Same categories for E actually, except they also like to do it online
* O dislike shooters, sports, and online, but like strategy, adventures, and puzzles
* A dislike everything that E like (coz it's violent?), and also like adventure
* C like non-shooter action and puzzles, dislike vehicles

> It's interesting to me that people high on C don't like strategy; I would have never guessed!
