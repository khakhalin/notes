STDP naturally organizes networks into long sequences. Power law distribution with about -1 gamma. Absolutely the closest experiment to what I do in my paper. Several sensitivity analyses; a mini-review of 2010 evidence for synaptic competition. When discussing songs in Zebra Finches, essentially hint at liquid state machines, but without calling them by name.
