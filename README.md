# Zettelkasten

This is my personal Zettelkasten system (knowledge base), built and updated with [Zettrl](https://www.zettlr.com/).

As it is a _personal_ knowledge base, some opinions may be wrong, the phrasing may be awkward, and many words may be spelled incorrectly. Yet the beauty of Zettlr as a Zettelkasten system is that every time I re-read these notes, I can try to improve them a bit, so the overall quality should be slowly, gradually improving.

Note that to link cards within the Zettelkasten system, Zettelr uses id-based links, such as this one: [[zettelkasten]]. GitHub, obviously, does not support this format, so in the public version of this base, all local links and references will be broken. But if really interested, you can always find these notes manually (z.B. [keywords/zettelkasten.md](https://github.com/khakhalin/notes/blob/master/keywords/zettelkasten.md))
