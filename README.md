# My Personal Zettelkasten

This is my personal Zettelkasten system (knowledge base), built and updated with [Zettrl](https://www.zettlr.com/).

As it is a _personal_ knowledge base, many opinions are wrong, the phrasing is awkward, and many words are spelled incorrectly. Also every time I don't know something, or am not sure about something, I just mark this part with a "dumpster fire" sign ðŸ”¥ , and go further. Yet the beauty of Zettlr as a Zettelkasten system is that every time I re-read these notes, I can try to improve them a bit, and the overall quality is gradually, very slowly, improving.

Note that to link cards within the Zettelkasten system, Zettelr uses id-based links, such as this one: [[zettelkasten]]. GitHub, obviously, doesn't "know" anything about this format, so in the public version of this knowledge base all local links and references are broken. But if you are really interested, you can always find respective notes manually (z.B., in this case, by going to [keywords/zettelkasten.md](https://github.com/khakhalin/notes/blob/master/keywords/zettelkasten.md))
