# Notes Zettelkasten

This is my personal Zettelkasten system (knowledge base), built and supported with [Zettrl](https://www.zettlr.com/).

Mostly it contains summaries of textbooks and papers that I read, together with my thoughts, comments, notes for self, and an occasional exasperated rant (mostly when I cannot understand something). As it is a _personal_ knowledge base, many opinions may be wrong, the phrasing may be awkward, and the words may be spelled incorrectly. The beauty of Zettlr as a Zettelkasten system is that every time I re-read my notes, I try to improve them a bit, so overall the quality is slowly improving (or at least I hope so).

For now this set of notes is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license. Maybe I'll switch to CC Attribution later. But overall, if you find any of this useful and reusable, you are always welcome to reference me.
