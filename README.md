# Zettelkasten

This is my personal Zettelkasten system (knowledge base), built and updated with [Zettrl](https://www.zettlr.com/).

As it is a _personal_ knowledge base, some opinions may be wrong, the phrasing may be awkward, and many words may be spelled incorrectly. Yet the beauty of Zettlr as a Zettelkasten system is that every time I re-read these notes, can I try to improve them a bit, so the quality should be slowly improving.

Note that to link cards within the Zettelkasten system, Zettelr uses id-based links, such as this one: [[Clear2019zettelkasten]]. GitHub, obviously, does not support this format, so in the public version of this base, all local links and references will be broken.
