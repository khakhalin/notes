# Pricing

* Read / find some theory on customer psychology
* Psychology of pricing with fixed and variable (proportional) components
* pricing elasticity - how is it defined? SOTA for measuring it?
* why softmax is apparently a decent choice for decision probabilit calculations?

Specifically for transportation?
* Models of transportation choice - any standard approaches to modling this choice?
