Modeled vision-controlled grasping (based on monkey data) as convolutional network (based on [[Alexnet]], it seems) → RNN (fully connected) → bottlneck of 8 neurons → another RNN → another bottleneck → another RNN → output. They call these bottlenecks "sparsity", which is interesting. I wonder whether it is fair to call it brain-inspired. Is it something that works, as it forces the learning of representations, and then only claim that it is brain-inspired, to give it some conceptual validity? Or is there actual evidence in the brain that connections between motor systems are throttled like that? Something to explore. Also they mention some "feedback connections" that may be connections between RNN modules, but I'd need to read the methods section carefully to see what's happening there. One of the most important aspects of this paper for me may be the neuro-inspired analysis of model performance that they do, and the very attitude to validation that they have. I wonder if that's something that can be applied to spiking networks.

Recurrent convolutional network  works better than a feed-forward convolutional network. It's slower, but better. Claim that it's similar to primate vision somehow.

Overview of how DL may be a model for the brain. At a first glance, seems less convinsing than Kording or Richards tbh.

Recurrent neural network models of multi-area computation underlying decision-making Michael Kleinman, Chandramouli Chandrasekaran, Jonathan C Kao
It seems that they try recurrent networks (RNN) running in parallel, and compare their decision times to that from monkey cortex. Then show that one RNN doesn't match the distribution of times, but if you have several running in parallel, and then synthesizing info, you get similar results? Claim that different modes of distributed computation are experimentally testable like that.

About how general anesthesia actually retains FF signalling, but disrupts feedback signalling, and it is enough to disrupt consciousness. In all cortical neurons. Seems fun, and  important to understand the logic of cortical processing.
