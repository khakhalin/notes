# Courses and links

## Courses

* [Stanford, linear dynamical systems](http://stanford.edu/class/ee363/lectures.html)
* That course on reinforcement learning - find the link
* [Matrix methods in data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx5Z-OslNWE&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k) - YouTube from MIT. Not my first choice, but may be good for refreshing things.
