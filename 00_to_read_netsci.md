Hmm. A very short illustrated mini-review, and the topic is good, but is it a good paper? Check.

Seminal, very short (2 pages) work. 40k refs!! That's because this particular type of rewiring became known as the **Watts-Strogatz model**, and everyone who used it, referenced this original paper.

A review of how simple developmental rules (in this case actual dendrites in 3D, growing and stopping) can produce different stochastic patterns, depending on the encoded rules.

Seems practical, and reasonable. They first make sure the data is ready to be analyzed (noise, downsampling). Takes considerable part of the text. Then they use a "0-1 test", resulting in one value K that is 0 for periodical, and approaches 1 for chaotic. Seems to be based on predictions for brownian motion, but need to look more closely.
