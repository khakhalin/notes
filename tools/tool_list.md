# ABCD

**Databricks Workspace** - workspace (environment) to interact with programs (jobs), notebooks, libraries, data.

**Dataiku** - some sort of visual programming language platform for data science?

**Docker** - Cloud computing service that provides a pratform with OS-level virtualization: an isolated user space (called **container**) that seems like a dedicated computer to programs running on it. Containers can talk to each other via defined channels. But unlike virtual machines, there's only one OS, so is less resource-hungry.

# E

**ECS** - Amazon Elastic Container Server. To manage (run, stop) **Docker** containers on a cluster.

# FG

**GCP** - Google Cloud Platform.

**Go**, aka **Golang** - statically typed compiled language by Google, similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, concurrency support, and structured type system.	

# HIJK

**Hadoop** - collection of open-source software utils for cluster support, maintained by Apache.

**Kafka** - open-source stream-processing plantform developed by Linkedin, written in Scala, and donated to Apache. High-throughput low-latency platform to handle realtime data feeds.

**Kubernetes** - Open-source system for deploying applications on a cloud. Originally developed by Google. Operates **pods** that each contains several **containers**, to be placed together, within the same localhost. Pods can communicate with each other via pod IP.

# LMN

# OP

**Plotly Dash** - A dashboard (interactive graphs and such) for Python and R. A bunchof JS, rendered in browser, that interacts with Python script that generated it via certain callbacks. These callbacks are put within the script in a certain way, and you can set (or know?) the functions the JS dashboard will call in Python when events happen in the dashboard, so you can define them, and thus process them.

**PubSub** or **Pub/Sub** - asynchronous messaging (event ingestion and delivery) service used by Google cloud. [wiki](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/tasks-vs-pubsub)

**PySpark** - a Pythonic language (wrapper) to run on a JVM and interact with **Spark**. Coz it's a wrapper, apparently doesn't like dynamic typing that Python tolerates, but other than that is mostly similar.

# QRS

**Scala** - functional programming language, conceived as an improved on Java, compiles to Java bytecode. Looks kinda vaguely like a mix of Java with Pascal; no semicolons; different ways to define variables, functions; declare types; can define control structures, and lots of other interesting stuff.

**Spark**, aka **Apache Spark** - a cluster computing framework (engine to work with big data). Written in **Scala**; donated to Apache. Runs on the JVM, nterfaces with programming languages, has its own SQL, graph processing, and what not.
