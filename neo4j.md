#database #graph


A popular graph database. Both nodes and edges can have properties. Written in Java. Freemium, GPLv3; apparently not-OSS? - there's some strange story about their licensing and their complex tiered system.

Uses it's own query language named Cypher (an open format). it can describe graph data (define nodes and edges, with their properties). Queries look a bit like [[sql]] with keywords like `WHERE` and `MATCH` (this one similar to sql's `SELECT`), but the values inside are little pices of graphs, drawn in ASCII art-style `(...)->(...)`.
