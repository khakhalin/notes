#nonparametric


A loose collection of methods that either are non-parametric, or "feel" non-parametric in the sense of being an alternative to common parametric methods :)

Alternatives to linear fit / regression:
* Theil-Sen estimator: a median of slopes through all lines through all pairs of points
* [[ransac]]
