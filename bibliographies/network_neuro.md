Bassett, D. S., Zurn, P., & Gold, J. I. (2018). On the nature and use of models in network neuroscience. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 1.
These days "a model" can mean many different things. Great figure with a summary of typical graph questions (communities, hubs, etc.) and extensions (dynamics, simplices). Hierarchy of models: descriptive (when graph makes it easy); predictive (dynamics, or edge dynamics). Then introduces another 3D classification: data vs theory, coarse vs low-level, and functional vs structural.
