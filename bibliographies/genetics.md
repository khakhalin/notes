The closest common father (based on NRY, aka Y-chromosome analysis: 50 to 100 kya = thousands of years ago) is much younger than the closest common mother (based on mitochondrial DNA: 200 kya). For non-African populations, smaller numbers, but a similar ratio (100 kya for mDNA; 50 kya for NRY). Y DNA is super-boring (similar everywhere) despite high mutability. 

There are several explanations, including periodical wiping out of almost all males, or some really fancy unobserved selective selction, but they claim a much more parsimonious model is that just most males didn't have kids, while most females had kids. As a result, we have about 2 times more female ancestors than we have male ancestors (due to double-counting of course).

They call the reasons for that a "sex-specific demographic processes". Claim that the fact that males are usually older then females when they have kids works in the same direction, but is not nearly strong enough to explain the discrepancy in variability. Possible explanations: polygyni (based on the Genghis Khan's DNA, even moderate amount of it can skew distributions a lot), or killing males from a different group, then taking their women as thralls (they don't use this language, but write about "sex bias in rates of migration among human populations").
