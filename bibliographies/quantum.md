A really cool review of how to best think and speak about quantum mechanics, and whether there are intuitive ways to conceptualize it. A really nice intro on the philosophy of reality!! (Including the idea of "open realism" - that is, a statement that the existence of objective reality is a useful notion , and thus is worth to be assumed
