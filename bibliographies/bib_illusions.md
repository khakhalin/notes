A very good richly illustrated review on illusions of tone perception created by shapes that are perceived as "photos" of 3D shapes with shadows. Summarizes  his (Edward Adelson) work on how the brain can essentially reconstruct 2 maps from one image: reflectance map (material) and illuminance map (shadows).

Bayesian interpretation of visual illusions? Very short (like, a report).

Hypothesis and theory article. While seems to claim (rightly) that the brain is a guesser, at least in the introduction, seems to also spin it philosophically in the direction of "everything is an illusion and objective perception is impossible", which I find rather questionable. If true, may even be used as a reference for "some people are mistaken about what illusions really are". But check first.
