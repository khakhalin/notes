Note: strictly speaking, in math, the term **stochastic** is very distinct from **chaotic**: chaotic behavior is generated by a deterministic system, while **stochastic** means that a system has some parameters or inputs that are assumed to be probabilistic. So stochastic has probabilistic inputs (and maybe outputs, although who knows), while chaotic has probabilistic outputs (or rather, outputs that can be, at the next level, analyzed as probabilistic). Biologists seem to be more lax in using these words, but mathematicians get really upset if these two are conflated.

There's a group of cells somewhere in the HB of young XL tads that keep recurrently firing for about 1 s after the mechanosens stimulus (even though shortest response is ~12 ms), and sometimes tadpoles still respond with this huge delay. Posit that this "noisification of response times" may be an evolutionary trick to make everything less predictable.

Young birds explore the song space, and their songs are highly variable. However this variability is not just "bad production"; there's a brain area (LMAN, one of the basal ganglia) that drives its variability. Spiking in this area is highly variable, and if you inactivate it, variability is gone.

They tricked rats into stochastic behavior by creating a competitive environment in which unpredictability was beneficial. Once all parameters were calibrated, the behavior was essentially unpredictable (from the experimenter's pov). Found that the cingulate cortex is the substrate.
