There's a group of cells somewhere in the HB of young XL tads that keep recurrently firing for about 1 s after the mechanosens stimulus (even though shortest response is ~12 ms), and sometimes tadpoles still respond with this huge delay. Posit that this "noisification of response times" may be an evolutionary trick to make everything less predictable.
