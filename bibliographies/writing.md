Subtopics:

* [[JohnMcPhee]] - another cool and idiosyncratic system of writing

Technical writing:
* [[diataxis]] - supposely, an important mindset for writing technical documentation

* [[design_docs]] - using writing to design systems

# Resources

Larry McEnerney on writing (potentially two best videos on post-academic writing ever):
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM - Larry McEnerney (University of Chicago Writing Program), on writing outside academia
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM - seems like either the same talk on a different day, or a somewhat more academic-oriented version of it. This one seems to have a section on reflective writing, inward-oriented writing (writing for thinking, [[zettelkasten]]-style) as well, not only on outward-facing, reader-oriented writing, as is the case for the first talk. A great inspirational video to watch before writing anything.

# Good Examples of academic writing

Haldane, J. B. (1926). On being the right size. _Harper’s magazine_, _152_, 424-427.

A beautifully written, nearly-poetic article about how animals of different size interact very differently with the environemnt. Some key quotes:
* You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes.
* A wet fly has to lift many times its own weight and, as everyone knows, a fly once wetted by water or any other liquid is in a very serious position indeed. An insect going for a drink is in a great danger as man leaning out over a precipice in search of food. If it once falls into the grip of the surface tension of the water - that is to say, gets wet - it is likely to remain so until it downs. A few insects, such as water-beetles, contrive to be unwettable; the majority keep well away from their drink by means of a long proboscis.
* The higher animals are not larger than the lower because they are more complicated. They are more complicated because they are larger.
* An angel whose muscles developed no more power weight for weight than those of an eagle or a pigeon would require a breast projecting for about four feet to house the muscles engaged in working its wings, while to economize in weight, its legs would have to be reduced to mere stilts.

Possibly the best beginning of a tough scientific text I've seen!):
* While driving home last night, I came to a fork in the road, where I had to make a choice: to take the freeway (X = 1) or go on a surface street named Sepulveda Boulevard (X = 0). I took Sepulveda, only to find out that the traffic was touch and go. As I arrived home, an hour later, I said to myself: “Gee, I should have taken the freeway.” What does it mean to say, “I should have taken the freeway”? Colloquially, it means ...
