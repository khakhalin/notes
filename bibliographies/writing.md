Larry McEnerney on writing (potentially two best videos on post-academic writing ever):
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM - Larry McEnerney (University of Chicago Writing Program), on writing outside academia
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM - seems like either the same talk on a different day, or a somewhat more academic-oriented version of it. This one seems to have a section on reflective writing, inward-oriented writing (writing for thinking, [[zettelkasten]]-style) as well, not only on outward-facing, reader-oriented writing, as is the case for the first talk. A great inspirational video to watch before writing anything.

# Good Examples of academic(ish) writing

Possibly the best beginning of a tough scientific text I've seen).
