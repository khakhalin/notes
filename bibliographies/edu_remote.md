**Specific ideas:**
* Biosem has to have both pre- and post- assignments, but probably no in-process (keep it honest to avoid spam)
* Think whether I should collect pre-questions via forms

**Reminders:**
* Have a meaningful Zoom handle (First + Last name), or you won't get an attendance point.

No, it doesn't. Making online medical students interact on a forum didn't improve their learning (but did improve their satisfaction). A smallish study, but not afraid of null effects, which is good.

Interesting white paper on best practices in online peer-learning:

Interesting idea about reflective interviews: asking another student about what they find good and hard about the course, and how to better deal with it.

An example (tiny video, a bit childish at the very end) of how NOT to participate, as it won't count:
