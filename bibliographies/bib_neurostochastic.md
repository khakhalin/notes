# Neuro and behavioral stochasticity

To find:
* Info on moths?
* What are those randomized neurons in the hindbrain (or where?) to which one can connect to randomize escapes?
* Brembs on flying flies?

Notes:
* [[Fraenkel1961woodlice]] - about how random motion is a good strategy
* [[Mitchell2002shell_games]] - about exploration / exploitation in small animals (similar to Levy walks described below)
* [[randomness]] - what randomness even is? Also randomness in humans
* [[levy_walks]] - random exploration / exploitation in space, used by various animals during foraging
