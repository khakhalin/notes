Sketches for how to teach kids non-school math?

**General plan**:
Symbolic logic → Statements with ∀, ∃ → Elementary set theory
Graphs
Elements of number theory

4. Groups
* Permutations
* Affine transforms and similar examples
6. Rings
7. Fields
* Polynomials
* Matrices
* Functions?

Lean towards discrete math, maybe with elements of computational (algebraic) geometry

But then inject calculus as well at some point, but with some key lemmas and theorems (??)
