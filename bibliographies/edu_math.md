# Math course

Sketches for how to teach kids non-school math?

**General plan**:
1. Symbolic logic
2. Elementary set theory
3. Statements with ∀, ∃
4. Groups
* Permutations
* Affine transforms and similar examples
6. Rings
7. Fields
* Polynomials
* Matrices
* Functions?

Lean towards discrete math, maybe with elements of computational (algebraic) geometry

But then inject calculus as well at some point, but with some key lemmas and theorems (??)
