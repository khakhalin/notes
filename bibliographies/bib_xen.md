Seem to compare different types of logic (angle, derivative of it), comparing it to human behavior in a test paradigm. Come up with a linear model that reasonably explains the data?

Compare spatial frequency tuning between naive and visually experienced larvae. See an improvement with experience.

Used reverse-correlation with bran recordings (from ZF larvae) to exactly pinpoint the stimulus detected by OMR circuits. As it turns out, it's a dark edge moving forward. Show funny image-like visualizations of "Behavioral-Triggered Averages" that feel a bit too complicated / counteritunitive to easily interpret. I originally thought these were the reverse-engineered stimuli, but they aren't, actually.

May be relevant to decision making, even tho it's not collision detection per se.

Without food, tadpoles enter developmental stasis: reduced neural proliferation. Everything resumes once food becomes available. Describe the molecular biology of it, what receptors are involved etc.

ðŸ’Ž If learning is involved, should be a good paper to read and cite, if I ever get to updating my preprint.
