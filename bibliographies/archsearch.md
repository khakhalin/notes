Papers:
* [[Ryoo2019video]] - evolving optimized network for video segmentation
* [[Gaier2019agnostic]] - looking for connectivities that work with any weights
* [[Xie2019randomwire]] - same, randomly wire networks, then pick those that work

Bio-inspired: see [[deepneuro]], but maybe in particular:
* [[Zador2019pure]]
* [[Sinz2019lessartificial]]

# Summary

Generalizing beyond [[hyperparameters]] too look for network architectures. One can look at various types of data augmentation, optimal activation functions, layers, or entire networks.
