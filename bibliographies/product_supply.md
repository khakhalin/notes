# Automation systems

Main competitors: o9, Kinaxis, Rulex (used to be called Oxygen), some [[sap]] modules (?)

> ðŸ”¥ ? I'm actually not sure if o9 tries to also compete with SAP, or whether they prefer to sit on top of it, and only compete with PS-specific modules of SAP. Also, it would be good to figure out how the market is structured by size. What solutions are primarily used by giant corporations, are there any good solutions for small business, and what's in-between.

# Dictionary

PS people really love abbreviations, so a short dictionary won't hurt:

* ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning (e.g. BlueYonder, [[sap]], Oracle SCM)
* FTL - Full Truck Load
* LTL - Less than Truck Load
* SCM - Supply Chain Management
* TMS - Transportation Management System
* WMS - Warehouse Management System
