# Dictionary

PS people really love abbreviations, so a short dictionary won't hurt. (See [[dictionary]] for a broader dictionary)

* ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning (e.g. BlueYonder, [[sap]], Oracle SCM)
* FTL - Full Truck Load
* LTL - Less than Truck Load
* S&OP - (sounds as SNOP) Sales and Operations Planning. Seems to be a generic term for any reasonable planning of operations that takes predicted sales into account :)
* SCM - Supply Chain Management
* TMS - Transportation Management System
* TPM - Trade and Promotion Management software. Whatever system that is used to track promotions (may be SAP, but more often is not)
* WMS - Warehouse Management System
