Compare a realistic biophysical model of a neuron to a perceptron. Show that a single neuron (pyramidal) can do a lot of computation (a perceptron-worth). While they modeled active dendrites and synaptic plasticity, they didn't really look at intrinsic plasticity. Reference Hay ..Segev 2011 as the source of their model. May be a good ref to stress how fancy intrinsic effects are often overlooked. Without intrinsic plasticity, and with all weights being treated equally, dendritic conductances do not help, and "all synapses on the soma" actually works slightly better (suggesting that cortical neurons may be more complex than just a peceptron).
