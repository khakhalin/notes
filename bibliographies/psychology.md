# Psychology at a glance

Some key psychology findings that held the test of time:
* Which [[personality]] traits are real, and which aren't
* Inability to "guess" someone personality quickly (see also [[recruiting]])
* That parents can't educate their children
* Some cognitive biases (my fav is loss aversion)
* Malleability of memories after remembering
* Some types of priming and false memories (based on semantic similarity)
* Serial position effects (we remember first and past)
* Congruence and cognitive dissonance (stroop effect, spatial congruence etc)

Some findings that turned to be fake, or weak, or didn't replicate:
* Red dress and sexual attraction
* Warm coffee priming
* Marshmallow test
* Ego depletion (cookies)
* Washing hands longer (soap) after recalling a morally shady incident
* ???

A great summative blog post by a person leaving academic research in social science (Joe Hilgard).

* One of his points: social psychology doesn't matter (at least right now), as if it mattered, we would have noticed a huge replication crisis of the 2000s. The fact that so many things were potently untrue and nothing collapsed (or stopped functioning) means that either the effects are too small, or academic results don't inform practical behaviors, or both.
