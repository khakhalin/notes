# Words and topics to look up

Basic questions
* How is PCA derived from XᵀX?
* Double-check what is eager about eager mode\
* Move old recommendatinos from Sven down here
* Make sure all Eric's recommendations are here

Classic ML and friends
* Hungarian algorithm
* Kalman filter (and its friends)
* RBF - Radial basis function kernel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel
* AdaBoost
* QDA - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
* Expectation-Maximization
* Bayesian PCA
* more on Gaussian processes
* Graphical models
* Hidden markov models
* Markov random fields (precursor of modern graph models?)
* Variational inference
* Resampling techniques: SMOTE, isotonic regression, Platt scaling

Deep Learning:
* How to tell the receptive field of a neuron in a deep network? Do they gradient descend on it?
* Do people use leakyReLus often? Do they prefer them for pruning, or is it ignored?
* ADAM optimizer - what's the difference from othes?
* Xavier initialization of weights - what's cool about it? Also, is it true that variance-scaled init is better? ([claim](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2017/10/02/practical-advice-for-building-deep-neural-networks/))
* inception blocks
* residual blocks / networks
* noise-contrastive estimation
* self-supervised boosting

Technical stuff
* Relational databases: Snowflake, Redshift
* regex in Python
* JSON - how does it work, why everybody love it, and is it the present or the future? ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON))
* YAML - some standard for keeping stuff that's like XML, but human-readable. Who uses it? Is it popular? ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML))
* bash
* Hadoop
* Spark

Random pieces of math
* How to calculate single-value-decomposion and eigenvector decomposition in practice?
* Refresh the general flavor of Lagrangians and Hamiltonians
* Perron–Frobenius theorem - something related to centralities and or network graph eigenvectors

Neuro
* ...
