practical intro to ML projects; look through:
https://github.com/chiphuyen/machine-learning-systems-design

Matrix calculus for deep learning

Introduction to probabilistic computation:
https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probabilistic_computation.html
Seems to be very good; simultaneously visual and mathy. Stochastic estimators and what not. Must-read!

Good collection of short tutorials (both ML and snippets of Python code) by Chris Albon:

Look through, decide the priority; how to file.

**ESL progress**
Current position: p290

Parked parts of ESL that need to be revisited:
* p161 to p218 - Smoothing, wavelets, smoothing kernels, local regression, kernel size choice
* p219 - a whole chapter on Model selection, Bias-Variance Tradeoff, effective number of parameters, cross-validation, and bootstrapping
* p261 - another whole chapter. Model averaging, max likelihood, some Bayesian inference, more bootstrapping, the EM algorithm (Expectation-Maximization), Gibbs samping, bagging, MCMC

**Deep Learning:**
* Why rotate pictures (augmentation) if we can just enforce rotationally-symmetric kernels. Is it possible? Is it desirable?
* What's so eager about eager mode, and why people like it?
* How to tell the receptive field of a neuron in a deep network? Do they gradient descend on it?
* Word2vec - how does it work? And does it come pretrained or what?
* residual blocks - why are they even a good idea? What's the deal here? How can it possibly help?
* Alexnet - some sort of efficient visual net that people use as a module. Is it pre-trained?
* Maximum Mean Discrepancy trick
* Replica trick and log-partition function (??)
* Gumbel-max trick
* Russian roulette trick
* Bayesian conjugacy trick
* Reparameterization trick
* Duality trick, easier Fenchel
* Doubly Reparameterized Gradient Estimators
* Do people use leakyReLus often? Do they prefer them for pruning, or is it ignored?
* Xavier initialization of weights - what's cool about it? Also, is it true that variance-scaled init is better? ([claim](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2017/10/02/practical-advice-for-building-deep-neural-networks/))
* inception blocks
