practical intro to ML projects; look through:
https://github.com/chiphuyen/machine-learning-systems-design

Matrix calculus for deep learning
https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html

Introduction to probabilistic computation:
https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probabilistic_computation.html
Seems to be very good; simultaneously visual and mathy. Stochastic estimators and what not. Must-read!

Good collection of short tutorials (both ML and snippets of Python code) by Chris Albon:

Look through, decide the priority; how to file.

ESL progress. 
Current position: p290

Parked parts of ESL that need to be revisited:
* p161 to p218 - Smoothing, wavelets, smoothing kernels, local regression, kernel size choice
* p219 - a whole chapter on Model selection, Bias-Variance Tradeoff, effective number of parameters, cross-validation, and bootstrapping
* p261 - another whole chapter. Model averaging, max likelihood, some Bayesian inference, more bootstrapping, the EM algorithm (Expectation-Maximization), Gibbs samping, bagging, MCMC

# Words and topics to look up

#todo: [[system_design]] - sorta priority

Python
* refresh strings functions in Python, like the full set of them
* f-strings in Python ([ref](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language)): summarize here somewhere, refresh
* ascii codes
* easiest way to convert '5' to 5 and the other way around
* sets in Python: are they worth it?

**Classic ML and algorithms**
* https://www.byte-by-byte.com/google-interview/
* https://www.byte-by-byte.com/strings/
* gradient boosting
* https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/fenwick.html
* https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html
* the difference between tSNE and UMAP
* what's the difference between hash-sets, hash-maps, and hash-tables?
* radix sort 
* that visual blog post about types of DL optimizers
* Hungarian algorithm
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation ([ref](https://towardsdatascience.com/end-to-end-topic-modeling-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-35ce4ed6b3e0))
* unit tests, pytests, mocking
* Bayesian PCA
* Bloom filter
* Kalman filter (and its friends)
* Expectation-Maximization
* Bayes Information Criterion - will be naturually described once I cover model selection?
* better understanding of Gaussian processes
* Graphical models
* Hidden markov models
* Markov random fields (precursor of modern graph models?)
* Variational inference
* Influence functions ([this pdf may help](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03260.pdf))
* Resampling techniques: SMOTE, isotonic regression, Platt scaling
* Principal variables
* Mahalanobis distance
* Particle filter

**Practical stuff:**
* Checkpoints
* Keras hyperparameter optimization

**Deep Learning:**
* What's so eager about eager mode
* How to tell the receptive field of a neuron in a deep network? Do they gradient descend on it?
* Word2vec - how does it work? And does it come pretrained or what?
* residual blocks - why are they even a good idea? What's the deal here? How can it possibly help?
* Alexnet - some sort of efficient visual net that people use as a module. Is it pre-trained?
* Maximum Mean Discrepancy trick
* Replica trick and log-partition function (??)
* Gumbel-max trick
* Russian roulette trick
* Bayesian conjugacy trick
* Reparameterization trick
* Duality trick, easier Fenchel
* Doubly Reparameterized Gradient Estimators
* Do people use leakyReLus often? Do they prefer them for pruning, or is it ignored?
* Xavier initialization of weights - what's cool about it? Also, is it true that variance-scaled init is better? ([claim](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2017/10/02/practical-advice-for-building-deep-neural-networks/))
* inception blocks
* noise-contrastive estimation
* self-supervised boosting
* Wavenet - that famous convolution network that generates audio on-the-fly

**Technical stuff**
* regex in Python
* JSON - how does it work, why everybody love it, and is it the present or the future? ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON))
* YAML - some standard for keeping stuff that's like XML, but human-readable. Who uses it? Is it popular? ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML))
* bash
* Python closures, why they are a thing, what's dangerous about them, and how to use them
* Jax: [Baysian NN in Jax](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gMAXn123Pm58_NcRldjSuGYkbrXTUiN2) - collab notebook 

**Other math**
* How to calculate single-value-decomposion and eigenvector decomposition in practice? How do they code it for numpy, for example?
* FFT
* Lagrange multiplyier - is there an easy (not formal, but intuitive) proof that it works?
* Hamiltonians and how dynamical systems invoke them
* Perronâ€“Frobenius theorem - something related to centralities and or network graph eigenvectors
* kuramoto oscillations
