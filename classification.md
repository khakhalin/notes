Subtopics:

Methods and model types:
* [[knn]] - K Nearest Neighbors
* [[linear_separation]] - conceptual preliminary step leading to Logistics Regression
* [[logreg]] - Logistic Regression
* [[lda]] - Linear Discriminant Analysis
* [[svm]] - Support Vector Machine
* [[ensembles]] - all sorts of tree-based models

Model assessment:
* [[validation]] - the process of
* [[confusion]] - confusion matrix: precision, recall, F1 score
* [[roc]] - Receiver Operation Characteristic and AUC measure
    * [[youdens-j]] - a single measure to quantify ROC height

Common problems and principles
* [[anomaly]] detection - how to identify an outlier, generated by a different process
* Class imbalance
    * [[smote]] - a very simple type of synthetic data that may still be better than resampling
