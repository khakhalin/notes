# Self-Supervised Learning

#bib #self-supervised #embedding #representation

**Subtopics:**
* [[embedding]]
* [[vae]] - autoencoders
* [[gan]] - GANs :)

**Related:**
* [[triplet_loss]] - aka contrastive loss or contrastive learning, aka **negative sampling** (which also seems to be a more popular term)
* [[word2vec]] - an example from text

**Papers:**
* [[Weng2019self-supervised.md]] - a review of sorts
* [[Yu2020lookback]] - graph networks and label propagation for few-shots learning, using embedding from both late and early layers.
* [[Zoph2020pretraining]] - pre-training on images hurts more often than it helps
