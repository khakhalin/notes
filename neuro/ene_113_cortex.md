# Cortex

Open questions:
* What part actually does subitation?
* Is it true that fusiform area processes glyphs? Or is it nearby?
* Is Prosopanosia related to dyslexia?
* Dyslexia in lefties? Men?

# Interesting areas

* Fusiform area was already covered in vision

### Insula

Wattendorf, E., Westermann, B., Lotze, M., Fiedler, K., & Celio, M. R. (2016). Insular cortex activity and the evocation of laughter. Journal of Comparative Neurology, 524(8), 1608-1615.

Apparently insula is activated with emotional laughter, but not with ticklish laughter.

## Subitation

## Language

Spontaneous emergence of language from noise:

That left and right-brain personalities don't exist:
Nielsen, J. A., Zielinski, B. A., Ferguson, M. A., Lainhart, J. E., & Anderson, J. S. (2013). An evaluation of the left-brain vs. right-brain hypothesis with resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging. PloS one, 8(8), e71275.

Nothing correlates basically.
