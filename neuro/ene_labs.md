## Simulators

Electrophysiology of the Neuron: http://eotnprogram.org
A re-write of a program and book put out by John Huguenard and David McCormick. Very flexible and can simulate real neurons as you can add a ton of different channels, can be used for passive properties too. Has some built in lessons (book can be downloaded for free) or you can design your own. Students have to download onto their computers, doesn‚Äôt work well on Windows 10 tablets.

MetaNeuron: http://www.metaneuron.org
I use this for my class to simulate AP properties, recovery from inactivation and to teach how to build IV curves. Downloadable and works well, but not a huge amount of features. Great for a large class as it always works.

Neuromembrane: http://neuromembrane.ualberta.ca 
More feature rich than MetaNeuron, shows activation and inactivation gates. Access online, but can crash if too many people are accessing at once (like a large class). Lots of adjustable parameters and neat animation (but play it at 4x speed - it gets repetitive after a while).

NGS: http://www.nernstgoldman.physiology.arizona.edu
Awesome online Nernst Goldman Simulator. Change conductances, ion concentrations and temperature. Runs as a Flash app on a browser, or as a downloadable Flash app, so Flash needs to be enabled. Now only officially available as an iOS app.

This is an alternative calculator, but not as polished: https://www.physiologyweb.com/calculators/ghk_equation_calculator.html

üíéüí° üß™ Neuronify: http://ovilab.net/neuronify/
This is a great neural circuits simulator, just drag and drop neurons, add synapses and spiking properties and create all sorts of circuits. Also can add sensors, like a light sensor using computer‚Äôs camera so you can look at RF, ON/OFF surround, etc. Works on a computer or using an app on an iPad. Really nicely done.

NeuroWiki: https://neurowiki.case.edu/wiki/Simulations

‚öóÔ∏èüìäüìâüìà Amazing Javascript simulations of various cells, and circuits, and other properties by Hillel Chiel as part of a neurophysiology course at Case Western: https://neurowiki.case.edu/

Neurosim 5: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~wjh/neurosim/modules.html
Fully fleshed simulation for teaching, runs in windows but can be run via a server and accessed via the web, so could be integrated into Canvas or other class environments.  Not free, but not expensive.

Virtual Neurons: http://www.brainu.org/lesson/virtual-neurons
Simpler neural circuit simulator, designed for pre-college students, but I still use it in my undergrad class as you can still get the basics of neural circuits and it is easy to use. Flash üíÄ

Physiogy Experiments: Monash University - https://ilearn.med.monash.edu.au/physiology/experiments.html

Great neuron simulators, particularly for systems neuro: nice visual recording simulation - change contrast, orientation and create downloadable data. Auditory tuning and somatosensory. 

vLab from Amrita University in India: http://vlab.amrita.edu/?sub=3&brch=212
and http://vlab.amrita.edu/?sub=3&brch=43
This is a really well implemented online neurophysiology curriculum, complete with a simulator and pre-made labs. They can be accessed as a guest for free, but cannot be customized for your class.

Neurons In Action: http://neuronsinaction.com/home/main

Not free. Commercially available as a set of tutorials built on NEURON environment but with accessible user interface. Some are pretty good, but they are not free, and interface is a bit clunky and non-intuitive. Good for a graduate or undergrad course. They‚Äôll send you a free copy if you tell them you might use it for a class. Probably won‚Äôt run for long, not maintained by publisher.

Emergent: https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page

Neural network simulator with a GUI. Fairly advanced but can be made accessible to students with a little up-front teaching, at least one undergrad course here uses it effectively. 

Xolotl: https://xolotl.readthedocs.io/en/master/

xolotl is a fast single-compartment and multi-compartment simulator written in C++ with a MATLAB interface. Downside is that it needs Matlab, which is not free.


NEURON: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/what_is_neuron

Powerful neuronal model builder, can use own programming language, GUI, Python or Matlab to interface with it. Here are some useful NEURON tools:

NetPyNe: http://www.netpyne.org
GUI for creating NEURON models and networks. Glitchy.

Tutorial from Oberlin: http://www2.oberlin.edu/octet/HowTo/NEURON/index.html

T2N: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5737656/
Matlab interface



Neurotinker: http://www.neurotinker.com

Neurobytes are physically connectable neurons that allow you to build controllable neural circuits, more ‚Äúlab-like" than online sims. Expensive, though, and not yet for sale (but apparently soon).


Braitenberg Vehicles Simulation: http://www.harmendeweerd.nl/braitenberg-vehicles/
Online simulation of a Breitenberg vehicle arena, customizable. Excellent for modelling behavior in simple automata.

Boids: Flocking simulation:  http://www.harmendeweerd.nl/boids/

Spikeling: Arduino based spiking neuron model, can be connected into a network, etc. 
https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006760&type=printable

HHMI Biointeractive: Leech neurophysiology simulation. Cute, but not super in depth, good for HS classes.
https://media.hhmi.org/biointeractive/vlabs/neurophysiology2/

Swimmy: motor pattern generation lab exploring connectivity and CPG
https://mdcune.psych.ucla.edu/modules/swimmy

HH-Sim: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/HHsim/
Matlab Based HH simulator, but can be downloaded. Has nice exercises, can manipulate channel gates.
