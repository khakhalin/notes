# Vision

General ideas: 
* Good exercise early on: draw an eye. Just take your time, and try to remember everything that there's there in an eye, that you heard about. How many parts can you remember, or expect there to be? If you remember nothing, try to re-imagine the eye. How would you have created a human eye, if you had to do it from scratch? (Using biological "components" of course; no metal and wires please!)
    * Then maybe still draw it with a mouse?
* that we cannot see Andromeda galaxy (show pics) as it's just blurry, large, and dim enough. Ironically, we would have seen it better if it was smaller, or if it had a sharper edge, or even if it was more uniformly colored. But it has this increase in lightness from the sides to the center that is almost perfectly canceled by our lateral inhibition, making it invisible.

Parts to be added to the presentation:
* What is hit first in the retina, what layer?
* A short tangent on how pictures are turned upside down, and how allegedly the brain "learns" to ignore that (that it's not realy true, as nothing to compare to). Compare to eyes not really being in the center of you, but being placed on the sides of your head, with a nose in the middle, yet we learn to figure out the world around us. We use whatever information we have to figure out the world, there's no comparing "reality" to "impression" here; it's just inferring reality from available information, and that's it.
