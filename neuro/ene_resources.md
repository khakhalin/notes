# Neuro resources

So a corollary: if you are lower-college and want to do some research or tutorials later, or whatever, or if you are upper college and may need letters of recommendation, try keep your cameras on next semester, in online and hybrid classes. Even if it is uncomfortable. At least some of the time. You want your profs to remember you! This world is rigged against introverts and people with social anxiety; it's not fair, I know. But I just recently realized that it may be almost more unfair in online classes. It's easier to hide; it's harder for you to speak up; it's also harder for me to call on people randomly (I originally wanted to do it, but chickened out). So, just something to think about. I think it's cruel when profs require students to have cameras on, or when they require them to speak up and participate... But on the other hand, it is in your interest to do both. Not in my class,Â
