# Practica lectures

**Introduce "Practica"** that are like lectures, but outside of a normal sequence. Currently planned:

**Syllabus**
* What it is and how to use it (using ours as an example)
* Motivation behind syllabi
* Goals of the course
* Why grades exist (and how it is reflected in this syllabus in particular)
* How participation will be graded (and there will be a required participation for this class!!)
* That we'll be using Piazza (described in a different video)
* Attendance and Zoom (including having names AND emails set up)
* The Bâ†’A situation at the end of class

**How to use Piazza**
* Unregister Joshua and show from the beginning how it looks when someone is registered. 
* Sorting using tags, finding the most recent post
* Post follow-ups, add a pic, ask a question, receive responses
* Posting new questions
* How to change email preferences

**How to read a paper**
* First, give a home assignment to figure out a structure of a paper
* Then follow that assignment that I got prepared?

**Google Scholar and basics of sci publishing**
* Find a paper when you know the title. 
    * Namely: paper XXX
* The concept of a paywall, and who pays for publishing papers
* Alternatives forms of a paper.
* Pre-prints (find a paper with a pre-print). What they are and what they mean.
* Find random stuff. 
    * Contribute some weird questions? or pre-think some weird questions?
    * Seach for: XXX?
* Authors with profiles.
* Other search engines (pubmed)
* What to do if a paper cannot be found
    * Library
    * SciHub. I try not to use it, if possible, as I realize that it takes money to run these servers, and I want them to keep running, so I try not to tap into them if possible. I tried to donate them money once, but because they are technically illegal, they don't accept PayPal, but one has to use BitCoin, and at this point it is just too complex for me. But I would donate them a bit of money if I could, the same I do for Wikipedia and Khan Academy. Also, honestly, I prefer not to use papers that are not accessible, if there's a choice, unless they are really old, as these days there is no excuse for authors not to post a pre-print, or a free version of a paper somewhere. It's really a sign of privilege when authors assume that their readers would get access to the journal they are publishing in, even if this journal is pretty common (like Science or Nature), as this access is freaking expensive.
    * Emailing the author. I mean, don't do it for this class, but generally if the author is still in business, they are typically happy to send their papers to those who asks for them.
* Citations - what does the total count mean? Let's compare some papers.
* How to see what papers cited this paper
* Best way to find info on a niche topic

* How to take notes (including Zettlr, pausing and stopping).
* How to use Excel
* A tiny intro video for every lab
* Neurotree (? add something - Neurotree alone isn't enough)
