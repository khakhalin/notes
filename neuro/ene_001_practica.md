# Practica lectures

**Introduce "Practica"** that are like lectures, but outside of a normal sequence. Currently planned:

**Syllabus**
* If I disappear from Zoom during a session, try to keep the discussion going for a few minutes in a hope that I would reconnect. (When the power spikes in the village, it takes my equipment ca. 5 minutes to reconnect to the internet).
* **Attendance and late policy** has to be more strict than in normal times, not less ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/i8ml4t/what_are_your_late_policies_this_semester/)). Explain the reasons. It's even harder to stay on track, harder to find motivation.
    * 5 min for Zoom meetings (we'll spend first 5 minutes meditating, but then we'll start)
    * 80% participation threshold
* That one can expect about 10 hours of study
* Put a clause that **everything may change** (as we never tried this format before), just it will never retroactive. Any change in grading only applies on behavior after the change was implemented.
* JoVE videos for labs?
* Remind on the **importance of taking notes** - _especially_ as the materials seems to stay with you (recorded lectures, notes), making it so tempting to just read. If you just read, you retain almost nothing (at least in the long-term, even in just a year for now). At the very least, take notes.
* Make sure to very explicitly explain in the syllabus **why peer-learning is a thing** (as it almost certainly seems ridiculous to them). Why interacting on Piazza is important, and not just busywork, and why we'll be trying to do breakout rooms on Zoom.
* A corollary: while it's cool that these days we can watch lectures on our phones, ideally, we shouldn't, as it's harder to take notes that way. Try not to. **Use a normal computer**, especially for Zoom meetings, but best - for lectures as well. (Unless you use some elaborate setup where you take notes in a notebook, while having the phone with a lecture somehow well secured etc.) In a pinch, when something happened and you cannot be at your working place, you can of course use phone to listen to a lecture, or even connect to Zoom... But for most sessions, try to study from a decent studying place, with access to your notes, to Google, textbooks, etc. Try to create a good working habit.

* What it is and how to use it (using ours as an example)
* Motivation behind syllabi
* Goals of the course
* What office hours are (and that it's a bit unclear to me how to implement them remotely. But I'll be working on it!)
* That we'll be using Piazza (described in a different video)
* Video lectures
        * This another spiel on doing it on a computer, on taking notes. The phones are tempting. And the problem is not that it's called a phone, or that a screen is small, but that you will be multitasking, and you won't be taking notes. That listening to the lecture doesn't help, even if it seems like it does. On really making a decision about whether you want to pass time, and maybe get a grade, or whether you want to learn something. Everyone decides for themselves, and it's up to you, bu you should be honest with yourself about what will take out of this course.
        * The best way to watch videos is to put them at 125% speed (by clicking the gear button), but pausing every time something non-obvious is said, and rewinding (with arrow keys) if necessary. And take notes!
        * Question pauses that I'll make
* Attendance and Zoom
    * Setup names and emails
* Google Hangouts are an alternative to Zoom when ZOom is out (piazza info). Email is an alternative to Piazza.
* Why grades exist (and how it is reflected in this syllabus in particular)
* How participation will be graded (and there will be a required participation for this class!!)
* The Bâ†’A situation at the end of class

**How to use Piazza**
* Unregister Joshua and show from the beginning how it looks when someone is registered. 
* Sorting using tags, finding the most recent post
* Post follow-ups, add a pic, ask a question, receive responses
* Posting new questions
* How to change email preferences

**How to read a paper**
* First, give a home assignment to figure out a structure of a paper
* Then follow that assignment that I got prepared?

**Google Scholar and basics of sci publishing**
* Find a paper when you know the title. 
    * Namely: paper XXX
* The concept of a paywall, and who pays for publishing papers
* Alternatives forms of a paper.
* Pre-prints (find a paper with a pre-print). What they are and what they mean.
* Find random stuff. 
    * Contribute some weird questions? or pre-think some weird questions?
    * Seach for: XXX?
* Authors with profiles.
* Other search engines (pubmed)
* What to do if a paper cannot be found
    * Library
    * SciHub. I try not to use it, if possible, as I realize that it takes money to run these servers, and I want them to keep running, so I try not to tap into them if possible. I tried to donate them money once, but because they are technically illegal, they don't accept PayPal, but one has to use BitCoin, and at this point it is just too complex for me. But I would donate them a bit of money if I could, the same I do for Wikipedia and Khan Academy. Also, honestly, I prefer not to use papers that are not accessible, if there's a choice, unless they are really old, as these days there is no excuse for authors not to post a pre-print, or a free version of a paper somewhere. It's really a sign of privilege when authors assume that their readers would get access to the journal they are publishing in, even if this journal is pretty common (like Science or Nature), as this access is freaking expensive.
    * Emailing the author. I mean, don't do it for this class, but generally if the author is still in business, they are typically happy to send their papers to those who asks for them.
* Citations - what does the total count mean? Let's compare some papers.
* How to see what papers cited this paper
* Best way to find info on a niche topic

* How to take notes (including Zettlr, pausing and stopping).
* How to use Excel
* A tiny intro video for every lab
* Neurotree (? add something - Neurotree alone isn't enough)
