Split into two: cortex then non-cortical area

Restructure the "brain areas" in the following way:
* first tell the canonical progression, and describe it as such. Maybe copy a slide from ML papers, even.
* Add a slide about cortical amplification (when discussing projections to V1).
    * Discuss why fovea is amplified
    * It's a good point to mention "upside-down image on the retina" - that it's a nonsensical claim
* Immediately after talking about color blobs, add visual illusion:
    * blurring down - can I do it realtime in GIMP?
    * we cannot really use color to see shapes - reading. Add an illustration that wild colors actually help, not hurt (grayish are only worse)
    * Watercolor illusion - example of "coloring an object"

**Lecture 2**
* Explicitly discuss other areas.
* Starting with pupillary reflexes
    * Show imperfection of this connection (and mention that it's not the same as recurrent laringial nerve (double-check the name!!), which is more famous. But a similar story.)
* Then circadian rhythms
* Then  [[pulvinar]]
* Then fusiform cortex.
    * And btw, is this innate? Yes, and no, which is a great example of how brains are. Based on monkey studies, our interest in faces is innate (we foveate to them and study them instinctively), but the face area forms (and works) properly only if we have this opportunity in early childhood.
    * Maybe mention dyslexia?
* Superior Colliculus and Blindsight. Also low frame-rate stuff.
* Sexual areas?
* Finish with the idea of massive parallel processing. Especially noticeable in case of motion. The nature of being human.


Things to add:
* A short tangent on how pictures are turned upside down, and how allegedly the brain "learns" to ignore that (that it's not realy true, as nothing to compare to). Compare to eyes not really being in the center of you, but being placed on the sides of your head, with a nose in the middle, yet we learn to figure out the world around us. We use whatever information we have to figure out the world, there's no comparing "reality" to "impression" here; it's just inferring reality from available information, and that's it.

Potential question for GoogleScholar searching:
* Why blocking serotonin (with LSD) creates visual illusions of motion and fragmentation?
