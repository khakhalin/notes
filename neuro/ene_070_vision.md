Restructure the "brain areas" in the following way:
* first tell the canonical progression, and describe it as such. Maybe copy a slide from ML papers, even.
* Add a slide about cortical amplification (when discussing projections to V1).
    * Discuss why fovea is amplified
    * It's a good point to mention "upside-down image on the retina" - that it's a nonsensical claim
* Add visual illusions, including "we cannot really use color to see shapes"- immediately after talking about color blobs
* But then explicitly discuss other areas.
* Starting with pupillary reflexes
* Then  pulvinar.
* Then fusiform cortex.
* Maybe mention dyslexia?
* Superior Colliculus and Blindsight. Also low framerate stuff.
* Sexual areas?
* Finish with parallel processing. Especially noticeable in case of motion. The nature of being human.


Things to add:
* A short tangent on how pictures are turned upside down, and how allegedly the brain "learns" to ignore that (that it's not realy true, as nothing to compare to). Compare to eyes not really being in the center of you, but being placed on the sides of your head, with a nose in the middle, yet we learn to figure out the world around us. We use whatever information we have to figure out the world, there's no comparing "reality" to "impression" here; it's just inferring reality from available information, and that's it.

Potential question for GoogleScholar searching:
* Why blocking serotonin (with LSD) creates visual illusions of motion and fragmentation?
