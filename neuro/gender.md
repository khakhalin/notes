_A draft for a possible class_

Three warnings:
1) I'm presenting my understanding of the current state of research. The research itself may change, and also I may misunderstand something. This is my honest best attempt, but it's not a settled field where you can just open a canonical textbook and learn the "truth", so keep it in mind.
2) It's a controversial and hotly debated topic, so for every position I try to state, there would be educated specialists, officially studying these topics, claiming that the differences are actually larger, and those claiming that they are smaller, or don't exist at all.
3) It's a politically charged topic, with lots of emotional and dishonest statements, so we need to be very careful with wording, and with understanding what other people mean when they speak on these topics. Some statements one can make about biology are pretty simple, but some may be pretty subtle. And when we speak about anything concerning human personalities and human behavior, most points are subtle. In fact, I'll try to start with subtleties and caveats, and only then go for some more direct statements, just to keep us prepared!

Caveats:
* Average vs distribution
* Probability vs guarantee: just because smoking increases the rate of lung cancer doesn't mean that every smoker will die of cancer, or every non-smoker won't. Even when a probability of event is pretty high, sometimes it won't happen, and the other way around.
* Humans are multifaceted and modular: one may be an amazing painter, but be bad at drawing, or the other way around. One can be a great improv speaker, but a bad writer, or a great writer who cannot speak publicly. Yes supposedly both of these people are "great with words". So what exactly would we mean if we say that someone has strong language skills, for example? That that they would tend to be both? Or either of two?
* Average vs. typical (that for high-D spaces, averages don't really make sense, and so average humans don't exist - see [[typical_sample]]). An average human has one breast and one testicle. The average position of the moon is in the center of earth (or the sun, or the galaxy, depending on how you think about it). _Better examples?_

Safe(r) examples of personal characteristics:
* Extroverts and saliva

There are almost no differences between male and female brains in humans, in terms of their morphology, as almsot all differences that are significant disappear once you control for brain size. And literature is a mess (many contradicting studies, many underpowered, or don't replicate from one group of humans to another). This includes no differences in lateralization, as judged from looking at commissures sizes.

Men may be larger than women not because of some evolutionary optimization, but as a weird byproduct of higher estrogen in women (that causes bones to fuse earlier). According to this hypothesis, higher estrogen is biologically relevant, and everything bone may be just a byproduct.
Uses other primates (chimps) as a counter-point for a statement that female pelvis is larger in primates even when there's no problem with childbirth.

Another paper from the same review:
DeWitte, S. N. (2018). Stress, sex, and plague: Patterns of developmental stress and survival in pre‐and post‐Black Death London. American Journal of Human Biology, 30(1), e23073.
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.23073
"After the Black Death, the bubonic plague pandemic that ravaged Europe in the 14th century, the average height difference between males and females increased by 62%: Men got about 9 centimeters taller and women got 5.5 centimeters shorter." Why? Better food → earlier maturation in women → earlier estrogen → smaller body size. (Really??? wow!)

**White-throated Sparrow** (a very common Eastern North American bird) has 2 **morphs** (white and tan -striped), and W mates with T. Different strategies: tan-striped are more peaceful, less competitive, monogamous (or is it only within one season?), and males contribute to parenting. White-striped are aggressive, trespassers, and seek more sexual partners. Differences are due to different receptor expression. All 4 (sex by type) types of kids are about similarly likely to happen (is it true? Or is one of the morphs more common?). See also [[strange_animals]].
