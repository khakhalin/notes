# Sex and gender (including differences)

_A draft for a possible chapter or video_

Three warnings:
1) I'm presenting my understanding of the current state of research. The research itself may change, and also I may misunderstand something. This is my honest best attempt, but it's not a settled field where you can just open a canonical textbook and learn the "truth", so keep it in mind.
2) It's a controversial and hotly debated topic, so for every position I try to state, there would be educated specialists, officially studying these topics, claiming that the differences are actually larger, and those claiming that they are smaller, or don't exist at all.
3) It's a politically charged topic, with lots of emotional and dishonest statements, so we need to be very careful with wording, and with understanding what other people mean when they speak on these topics. Some statements one can make about biology are pretty simple, but some may be pretty subtle. And when we speak about anything concerning human personalities and human behavior, most points are subtle. In fact, I'll try to start with subtleties and caveats, and only then go for some more direct statements, just to keep us prepared!

Caveats:
* Average vs distribution
* Probability vs guarantee: just because smoking increases the rate of lung cancer doesn't mean that every smoker will die of cancer, or every non-smoker won't. Even when a probability of event is pretty high, sometimes it won't happen, and the other way around.
* Humans are multifaceted and modular: one may be an amazing painter, but be bad at drawing, or the other way around. One can be a great improv speaker, but a bad writer, or a great writer who cannot speak publicly. Yes supposedly both of these people are "great with words". So what exactly would we mean if we say that someone has strong language skills, for example? That that they would tend to be both? Either?
* Average vs. typical (that for high-D spaces, averages don't really make sense, and so average humans don't exist - see [[typical_sample]]). An average human has one breast and one testicle. The average position of the moon is in the center of earth (or the sun, or the galaxy, depending on how you think about it). _Better examples?_

Safe(r) examples of personal characteristics:
* Extroverts and saliva
