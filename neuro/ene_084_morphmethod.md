# Brain morphology and methods

## Methods

**Todo**
* Enumerate methods, and add a summary slide, to make it clearer.
    * Add:
        * EEG
        * EMG
        * CT scan (and how it is different from MRI, so put it after MRI)
        * Activity dependent methods:
            * Old radioactive brains (synaptogenesis)
            * Fluorescence of early genes and stuff like that

## Morphology
* A bit of development
* Quick-and-dirty summaries
