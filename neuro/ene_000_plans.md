# Plans for the Neuro course

See also: [[edu_remote]]

# Todo

* Integrate creativity theme (from existential) into the course: https://piazza.com/class/k5wsvihi6ya3bb?cid=31 into both readings and the lecture
* pain in the AP lecture (as one of three special cases)
* CPG - palfrey - add
* go through the labs
    * We need the "hot test" lab for the first week **urgently**!
    * Brain Hack book - flip and pick
* Redistribute topics in the syllabus.
* existential stuff - distribute
* Put the actions where the words are and add a real-world example for every topic. Brain death and what not. Make it more citizen science. For the first time ever, you have time to talk about it (theoretically).
* How to even teach labs over zoom? Do we do something, then run through it, then reconnect?
* Read how to be a bat
* When basal ganglia: fainting goats
* Add HM to memory
* Move CPG hierarchy for motor into motor, and add what I used to draw on the board
* Can the host join Zoom breakout rooms?

* In some lecture, tell this little story about a new age book that had a separate sign "meditate here", that I found somewhat obnoxious. Yet here it kinda makes sense. It may be corny, yes, but try to embrace it, and hopefully it will work (even though nothing replaces a real classroom of course).

# Organizational Ideas

* **Regularly Initiate meta-discussions on Piazza** (how is the course going?). Early on. Make it a habit. Use "Meta" channel.
* Have one weekly post with all related assignments, nicely collected. Clarity! Clear predictable deadlines.
* Separate into required (lectures + existential) and advanced (major-level).
* Invite Silas, Molly, Addie, Sam, Maia, for short talks about different topics? Pre-recorded, not realtime?

# Random reminders for myself

* What to do for break-up during "Join Zoom"
* Make sure everyone are enrolled in both halves of the course
* Make sure everyone has zoom properly configured (with emails)
* Zoom only keeps meeting reports for a month, so download participation logs weekly.

On peripheral nervous system - how lie detectors and polygraph are all a lie.

When discussing parallel processing and how we are used to be slow, which makes parallel processing inevitable: an even more extreme example is flash lag (predictive processing of smooth motion):

**Peripheral lag**: what's its proper name?

Can we measure it? Can it be a lab?
