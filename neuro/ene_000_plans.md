# Plans for the Neuro course

See also: [[edu_remote]]

# Todo

* Make sure to add more art and philosophy back, as reading, or arts people will be sad
* add creativity back for example
* add some visual arts (find something new?)
* Explain how to watch videos. Do pep talks on how it's on them to study or not. I cannot force them :)
* Make sure dreams and sleep phases are included (with memory?)
* Try to add info about Navalny and Putin, when ACh
* Integrate creativity theme (from existential) into the course: https://piazza.com/class/k5wsvihi6ya3bb?cid=31 into both readings and the lecture
* Redistribute topics in the syllabus.
* existential stuff - distribute
* Put the actions where the words are and add a real-world example for every topic. Brain death and what not. Make it more citizen science. For the first time ever, you have time to talk about it (theoretically).
* Read how to be a bat
* When basal ganglia: add fainting goats
* Add HM to memory

# Organizational Ideas

* Make them write their own crite-sheets, in a way. And self-grade, based on the amount of work they submitted so far.
* For missed homeworks, come up with an alternative assignment that closes this homework. Something that is simpler than a paper, but not a question. Maybe pick up an interesting topic and write a page about it? Not too long, but noticeably longer than a question. But ideally, something that doesn't feel like busywork.
* For the final paper, make them write these double-paper short articles. Introduce a rubric, force comparison of papers. No feedback from me, but two rounds of peer-review.

* Re-record the syllabus lecture
* In some lecture, tell this little story about a new age book that had a separate sign "meditate here", that I found somewhat obnoxious. Yet here it kinda makes sense. It may be corny, yes, but try to embrace it, and hopefully it will work (even though nothing replaces a real classroom of course).

Other:

* **Regularly Initiate meta-discussions on Piazza** (how is the course going?). Early on. Make it a habit. Use "Meta" channel.
* Memes, not haikus. Make them make memes.
* Separate into required (lectures + existential) and advanced (major-level).
* Invite Silas, Molly, Addie, Sam, Maia, for short talks about different topics? Pre-recorded, or  realtime?

# Topics and links

Go through cit-sci-like topics, and place them again

On peripheral nervous system - how lie detectors and polygraph are all a lie (that's a link to reality!)
Potentially look at this article (haven't read it yet, but it's recent): https://theintercept.com/2020/08/12/blueleaks-law-enforcement-police-lie-detection/

When discussing parallel processing and how we are used to be slow, which makes parallel processing inevitable: an even more extreme example is flash lag (predictive processing of smooth motion):

# Deeper stuff - not likely to happen

**Peripheral lag**: what's its proper name?

Can we measure it? Can it be a lab?
