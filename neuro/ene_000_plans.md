# Plans for the neuro course

### Ideas

* Late policy has to be more strict than in normal times, not less ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/i8ml4t/what_are_your_late_policies_this_semester/)). Explain the reasons. It's even harder to stay on track, harder to find motivation.
* Put a clause that everything may change (as we never tried this format before), just it will never retroactive. Any change in grading only applies on behavior after the change was implemented.
* Remind on the importance of taking notes - _especially_ as the materials seems to stay with you (recorded lectures, notes), making it so tempting to just read. If you just read, you retain almost nothing (at least in the long-term, even in just a year for now). At the very least, take notes.
* A corollary: while it's cool that these days we can watch lectures on our phones, ideally, we shouldn't, as it's harder to take notes that way. Try not to. In a pinch, when something happened and you cannot be at your working place, you can of course use phone to listen to a lecture, or even connect to Zoom... But for most sessions, try to study from a decent studying place, with access to your notes, to Google, textbooks, etc. Try to create a good working habit.
* When recording lectures, pause for questions, maybe also showing a standard pic on the screen? In the middle of a presentation?
* Introduce "practica" that are like lectures, but outside of a normal sequence. For example, how to use google scholar (ask them to contribute some weird questions? or pre-think some weird questions?). How to read a paper. Neurotree. How to take notes (including Zettlr, pausing and stopping). How to use Excel.

### Random notes

Make sure enrolled in 2 different courses

Zoom only keeps meeting reports for a month, so download participation logs weekly.

# Topics

When discussing parallel processing and how we are used to be slow, which makes parallel processing inevitable: an even more extreme example is flash lag (predictive processing of smooth motion):

See: [[flagh_lag]]

**Peripheral lag**: what's its proper name?

Can we measure it? Can it be a lab?
