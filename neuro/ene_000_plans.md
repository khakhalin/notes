# Plans for the neuro course

General ideas
* Late policy has to be more strict than in normal times, not less ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/i8ml4t/what_are_your_late_policies_this_semester/)). Explain the reasons. It's even harder to stay on track, harder to find motivation.
* Remind on the importance of taking notes - _especially_ as the materials seems to stay with you (recorded lectures, notes), making it so tempting to just read. If you just read, you retain almost nothing (at least in the long-term, even in just a year for now). At the very least, take notes. _Maybe show them my zettlr? Some notebook with lots of notes for myself?_
* Put a clause that everything may change (as we never tried this format before), just it will never retroactive. Any change in grading only applies on behavior after the change was implemented.

# Topics

When discussing parallel processing and how we are used to be slow, which makes parallel processing inevitable: an even more extreme example is flash lag (predictive processing of smooth motion):

**Peripheral lag**: what's its proper name?

Can we measure it? Can it be a lab?
