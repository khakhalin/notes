When Brandon C. Roy's son was born, for 3 full years, he recorded every single word heard by the child, and spoken by the child. Thus documenting a complete landscape of language acquisition.

Red-toothed shrews seasonally shrink and regrow both the skull and the brain by ~20% (!!), to save on metabolism costs (they don't hibernate in winter, and their metabolic rate is exceptionally high overall). Known as "Dehnel’s phenomenon". Note that they only live for 2 years, so their life history is like "Baby → smart youngester → stupid subadult → smart sexually mature adult". Keeping them at const temperature in a lab makes them retain high brain volume through winter.
