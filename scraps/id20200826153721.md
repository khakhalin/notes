They performed a meta-analysis of 54 studies, and showed that the effect of reading books together with kids (5-7 year olds?) on their language development is much smaller than believed. It exists, but it's very small. 

Why does not it work?

* Most studies exaggerate the effect, but use a rather short intervention. One can believe that with a longer intervention (more than a few months - at the scale of years) the effects would be much stronger.
* Much of this effect is non-specific: not about books per se, but just about the fact that an adult interacts with the kid. Especially if an "active control" is used (they do something together).
* They only looked at studies that looked at normal kids that were doing fine overall, and either added some more reading or not. So obviously at extremes the effect would be extreme as well, but we're not talking about that.
