Slack Is the Right Tool for the Wrong Way to Work

Basically, normalizes constant interruptions, a never-ending chat that is too slow to dedicate undivided time to it, but too frequent and ever-present to let people concentrate on their work. Interruptions at least every 5 minutes. Counterproductive.

While "chatting over email" is of course worse, this is still generally a move in a wrong direction.

> I like the policy of "Only dedicated meetings + summaries in emails". No back-and-forth in emails, but also no simmering chats. Set aside some time, and collaborate. Unless you're actively mentoring, guiding someone through the project, there's no point in sitting on Slack all the time.
