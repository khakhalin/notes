Interesting school in Paris: Ecole42 (or just 42): a peer-to-peer school without teachers.

His estimation of time it takes to become an independent ML practitioner: 

* FastAI (3 mo)
* Personalized projects / reproduce papers (3-12 mo)
* Flashcard the Deep Learning Book (4-6 mo)
* Flashcard ~100 papers in a niche (2m) _So that's roughly 2 papers a day, right? That's hard!_
* Publish first paper (6 mo)

So 2-3 years in total. Hmm.

Good advice: **for personal projects, aim at compute time <10 minutes**. Main reason: you cannot contribute productively if you don't optimize hyperparameters, and with longer compute you won't be able to do a **hyperparameter sweep**. Which means that you'll stuck to suboptimal ad-hoc choices.

Endorses "The measure of Intelligence" by Francois Chollet [[Chollet2019measure]].

A fun list of "alternative" (small-computer) areas of research, and potential sources for ideas.

Also a long discussion of how to **reform hiring process**, making it less official-education-dependent, and more personal-project dependent, which I kind of like, but not a greatest fan of.  Soudns mostly reasonable, but not ideal.
