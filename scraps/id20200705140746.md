Main point: the interpretation rigor had fallen, as most solutions are now nois, proprietory, and kinda "plug-and-play" (he calls it "turnkey"). The code is often not provided, assumptions are unclear, and predictions aren't only noisy, but sometimes aren't even stable (are different upon rerun).

The "trust but verify" mentality is largely lost.
