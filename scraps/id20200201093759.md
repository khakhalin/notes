Original title: Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats)

A nice table about how t-test, correlation (both Pearson and Spearman), Wilcoxon, Kruskall-Wallis, and Chi-square are all either approximately, or, in most cases, exactly equivalent to a linear model `lm(y ~ something)`. Which has a pedagogical implication that theoretically one could just teach lm() as the only tool, and only later reveal the aliaces.
