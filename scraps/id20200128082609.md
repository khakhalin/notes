# Hamming on young mathematicians

#society #side #academia #math

Richard Hamming claimed that mathematicians and theor. physicists publish their most influential work “disgustingly young” (sic) not because they get dumber with age, but because of a shadow of success. They are afraid to start anew, ask small questions again, make baby steps.

Hamming called it “planting acorns”. Because mighty oaks only grow from small acorns. Early success is like a curse.
