# Ideas for Zettlr

Clicking (or maybe Ctrl-clicking) on the home folder (on the left) should scroll the list of files to the top. Currently - shows the last active file, which is more often than not in one of the child folders, far down the list, which means that higher files are only accessible with a mouse wheel / slider. "Home" button also doesn't help, as the file list window does not have focus during this.

Back button? Is there a back button?
