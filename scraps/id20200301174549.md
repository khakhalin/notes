Interesting remark by David Ha: hiding some info from bots (agents) may actually help their performance, as it gives fewer weapons to their opponents. Reduces a possibility of adversarial attack. Say, if an agent tracks the position (or posture) of another agent, not only the motion of the ball, it may be possible for the adversary to exploit existing logic, paralyzing the agent. But if the agent only "sees" the ball it doesn't happen, as the expressiveness of the ball is limited :)

David calls it **Inattentional blindness** (which is a metaphor I find a bit strange in this case), but the general logic is that withholding information can lead to better training, and stronger agents.

Other twitterers immediately contributed nice human maxims, such as "keep the eyes on the ball", and "focus on the game, not the player".
