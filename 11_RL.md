A sequence of two papers that explore unsupervised exploration of possible behaviors in a virtual environment. SOTA?

Exploration in RL (a sort of blog-review with math, just published (June 2020), so should be bleeding edge?)

A popular RL paper about Atari games. Other papers (PCGRL: Khalifa 2020) reference it as "fractal networks", even though the term isn't used in this paper itself.

Reward-Conditioned Policies. Aviral Kumar, Xue Bin Peng, Sergey Levine. 2019.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13465
Some sort of mix between RL, learning by imitation, and trying to infer better policies from observed examples. Kinda like self-supervised, in a sense of introducing an inner supervized loop that feeds from the outer RL loop. The intro sounds as if they were claiming that learning bad policies together with the rewards they yield can be helpful for extrapolating to better policies? Not sure.

Instead of maximising rewards, they maximize evidence for an internal generative model. Also use _free energy of the expected future_. Hmm. [[freeenergy]]? Looks quite mathy.
