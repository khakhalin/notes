# Linear algebra, Basics

### Linear and affine

Linear means f(ax) = a f(x), and f(a+b) = f(a)+f(b). Examples of linear: negation, reversal, running sum, demeaning (subtract mean(x) from all x_i elements of x).

*Th*: If f(x) is linear, it can be represented as a matrix multiplication Ax
Proof: x = sum x_i e_i , and as f is linear, f(x) = sum x_i f(e_i) where f(e_i) is in out-space (codomain) of f. If we write coordinates of each f(e_i) in this space, we get a matrix with columns of f(e_i), and f(x) = Ax. QED 

What most people think of as "linear" is actually affine: Ax+b (linear + const). This representation is unique, and A = (f(x)-f(0)) - because -f(0) kills the "b" part, and then we have f(x)-b linear, so see above.

First-order Taylor approximation: f(x) ~ f(x0) + Df(x0)(x-x0) where D = Jacobian, or matrix of all possible derivatives of coordinates of f over coordinates of x: Df_ij = df_i/dx_j . Obviously affine.

### Linear equations

Ax = b

Interesting examples:
* Ax = b means that b is a linear combination of columns in A. If x exists, then b can be represented like that.
* Polynomical interpolation: y_i = sum x_i^k c_k . It means that if A_ij = x_i^j , it's a matrix equation. This A_ij is called a *Vandermonde matrix*.

**Markov model**, aka linear dynamics model : states in next moment of time x(t+1) = Ax(t). A is a matrix of transitions. (There may also be an input with matching dimensions). Example of a model: pandemics (not as a network model, but a basic model of transitions: health -> infected -> either recovered or dead).

Same can be used to numerically solve DE, as x = x + x'dt, so A = (1 dt ; 0 1) would take (x, dx/dt) and produce a new pair.
